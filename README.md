# Novel Writing with Windsurf

let's write a novel with windsurf lmao

50,487 words lol

## Process

This novel was written using Windsurf and its AI capabilities, following a structured approach:

1. **Initial Plot Outline**: A comprehensive plot outline was generated to establish the core story elements and narrative arc.

2. **Three-Part Structure**: The story was divided into three distinct parts, each with its own detailed outline to ensure cohesive progression.

3. **Chapter Breakdown**: Each part was further broken down into individual chapters, with detailed outlines for each chapter to maintain consistency and narrative flow.

4. **Chapter Writing**: Each chapter was then expanded into a 1,000-1,500 word piece based on its respective outline, ensuring depth and detail while maintaining the overall story structure.

## Challenges

During the writing process, several technical challenges were encountered:

1. **Chapter Length Variability**: Despite instructions to maintain a minimum of 1,000 words per chapter, Windsurf tended to generate progressively shorter chapters when writing multiple chapters at once. This suggests potential limitations in handling longer prompts or maintaining consistent output length across multiple iterations.

2. **Tool Errors**: After completing a chapter, Windsurf frequently encountered various "cascade" and tool errors without clear descriptions. These errors often prevented the system from continuing the writing process smoothly.

These issues may be related to limitations in the AI's context window - as more content accumulates, the system may struggle to maintain consistent output quality and length while processing larger amounts of context.
