**Part 3: The Starfall Menace**

*   **Chapter 15: The Heart of the Machine:** They reach the control center or power core. Confrontation with Commander Xylar (perhaps a projected image or a series of logical traps).
*   **Chapter 16: The Final Battle/Clever Solution:** Instead of pure destruction, perhaps they find a way to communicate or trick the AI. Maybe they exploit a logical flaw in its programming or introduce a "virus" (a magical one, perhaps, or a very clever mechanical one from Sprocket). The solution emphasizes brains over brawn, though Pip's knightly valor is still key to getting them there.
    *   *Subplot: Learning that True Strength is More Than Fighting:* Pip understands that his courage, combined with his friends' intelligence and skills, is the true weapon.
*   **Chapter 17: Aftermath and a New Dawn:** The Starfall is disabled or departs. The kingdom rejoices. Pip is hailed as a hero, but he remains humble, valuing his friends and the lessons learned.
*   **Epilogue:** Pip, Hazel, and his family look up at the stars, wondering about other worlds, but content in their own, now safe. Pip continues to protect his home, a true knight.
