# Chapter 19: The Starfall's First Sign

The night was unusually still as Pipkin lay in his bed, staring up at the ceiling. The moonlight filtered through the window, casting long shadows across the room. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was different tonight - the air felt charged with anticipation.

Suddenly, a soft tapping at the window caught his attention. Pipkin sat up to see Whisperwind, the ancient owl who had once warned his father about dangers past. The owl's eyes glowed with an otherworldly light as he hooted softly.

"Come," Whisperwind said, his voice a whisper on the wind. "There is something you must see."

Pipkin quickly dressed and followed the owl to the training grounds. As they reached the courtyard, he saw that several other trainees had also been summoned - including Grizelda and Thumper.

"Look to the sky," Whisperwind instructed.

Pipkin raised his gaze and gasped. High above the Citadel's spires, strange lights danced across the night sky. They weren't like any stars he'd seen before - they moved with purpose, tracing patterns that seemed almost... intelligent.

"What are those?" Grizelda whispered, her voice filled with awe.

"They are the first signs," Whisperwind replied gravely. "Signs of what is to come."

The other trainees began to murmur among themselves, their ears twitching with unease. Pipkin felt a chill run down his spine as he watched the lights. They seemed to be communicating with each other, forming patterns that shifted and changed.

"What do they mean?" Thumper asked, his voice unusually subdued.

"They are heralds," Whisperwind said. "Heralds of the Starfall."

The words hung in the air like a warning. Pipkin remembered the stories his father had told him about ancient threats from beyond the stars. Could it be that those legends were about to become reality?

Over the next few nights, Pipkin began to notice more patterns in the strange lights. They appeared at regular intervals, tracing paths that seemed to converge on certain points in the sky. He started keeping notes, trying to understand their movements.

"What are you doing?" Grizelda asked one evening as she found Pipkin poring over his sketches.

"I'm trying to understand the lights," Pipkin replied, showing her his drawings. "They move in patterns - patterns that seem too deliberate to be random."

Grizelda studied the sketches, her eyes narrowing. "You might be right," she said slowly. "But what does it mean?"

"I don't know," Pipkin admitted. "But I feel like we're supposed to understand something. Like these lights are trying to tell us something."

Sir Reginald noticed Pipkin's fascination with the lights and called him aside one evening. "I see you're studying the sky," the instructor said, his voice serious. "Good. A true knight must be observant. But remember - sometimes what we see is not what we think it is."

As the days passed, the sightings became more frequent. Pipkin couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched - that something vast and ancient was stirring in the darkness beyond the stars.

"What do you think it means?" Grizelda asked one night as they watched another display of lights.

Pipkin sighed, his ears drooping. "I don't know. But I have a feeling that whatever it is, it's going to change everything. And we need to be ready."
