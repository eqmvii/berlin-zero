# Chapter 20: The Forest Patrol

The first blush of dawn crept over the treetops as Pipkin tightened the straps of his satchel, his heart beating with a mixture of excitement and unease. The Citadel was quiet at this hour, the only sounds the distant clatter of kitchen pots and the soft cooing of doves on the parapets. Grizelda stood beside him, her fur brushed to a silvery sheen, her eyes sharp and determined. The two young knights-in-training waited in the shadow of the archway until Sir Reginald appeared, his cloak trailing behind him like the wing of some ancient bird.

“The lights we’ve seen are not just random occurrences,” Sir Reginald said, his voice low but urgent. “There are signs of something… unusual in the forest. I want you two to investigate. Trust your instincts, but be careful. Report anything out of the ordinary. The fate of the Citadel may depend on what you find.”

Pipkin swallowed, feeling the weight of responsibility settle on his small shoulders. Grizelda gave him a reassuring nudge. “We’ll be careful, Sir,” she promised.

As the sun’s first rays filtered through the mist, Pipkin and Grizelda slipped into the forest. The air was crisp and tinged with the scent of pine and earth. Every step muffled by moss, they moved quietly, ears perked for any sound that didn’t belong. Pipkin’s mind raced with questions—what could be causing the strange lights? Was it really the Starfall, or something else entirely?

For a while, the patrol felt almost peaceful. Sunbeams danced on dew-laden leaves, and the songs of robins echoed above. Pipkin tried to steady his nerves by focusing on the rhythm of his steps and the gentle swish of Grizelda’s tail ahead of him.

Suddenly, Grizelda halted, one paw raised. “Wait,” she whispered. Her nose twitched and her eyes narrowed. “Do you smell that?”

Pipkin inhaled. Beneath the familiar scents of the forest, there was something acrid, metallic—like lightning after a storm. He nodded, signaling for Grizelda to lead on.

They crept forward, weaving between ferns and twisted roots. The forest floor sloped downward, and soon they found themselves in a hollow where the air felt strangely charged. That’s when Pipkin saw it—a faint blue glimmer beneath a tangle of brambles.

“Look!” Grizelda hissed, pointing with her paw.

They approached cautiously. The object was a shard of metal, unlike any Pipkin had ever seen. It was cool to the touch, but as he held it, a gentle pulse of light traveled along its surface, as if the metal itself was alive.

Grizelda examined it closely. “This isn’t from any tool or weapon I know,” she murmured. “It almost feels… wrong.”

Pipkin’s mind flashed back to Whisperwind’s warnings—tales of falling stars and machines that walked like beasts. “This is what Whisperwind was talking about,” he whispered. “It’s not natural.”

They wrapped the shard in a scrap of cloth and pressed on. The deeper they ventured, the more signs they found: trees with bark scorched black, their branches twisted as if by some invisible hand; patches of earth fused into glassy, lifeless sheets; and, at the center of a clearing, a shallow crater where the soil still smoldered.

Grizelda crouched by the crater’s edge, running her paw through the ash. “These aren’t just accidents,” she said, her voice trembling. “Something powerful did this. Something not of this world.”

A sudden rustle in the undergrowth made them both freeze. Pipkin’s heart hammered in his chest. He signaled for silence, and together they crouched low, barely daring to breathe. The forest seemed to hold its breath with them.

A shadow flickered at the edge of the clearing—a shape, small and quick, darting between the trees. Pipkin caught a glimpse of something metallic, a faint blue glow trailing in its wake. It moved with an unnatural smoothness, almost gliding above the ground.

Grizelda’s eyes widened. “Do you see that?”

Pipkin nodded, gripping his staff tighter. “Stay behind me.”

They watched as the creature—or machine—paused, scanning the clearing with a single, unblinking lens. For a moment, Pipkin thought it might sense them, but then it darted away, vanishing into the shadows as quickly as it had appeared.

The silence that followed was deafening. Pipkin let out a shaky breath. “That was a Starfall scout,” he whispered. “It must be searching for something.”

Grizelda nodded grimly. “Or someone.”

They waited until they were sure the creature was gone before moving again, this time more cautiously than ever. Every snapped twig, every flutter of wings above, set their nerves on edge. Pipkin’s thoughts raced—what if the Starfall was watching them even now?

As they continued their patrol, they found more evidence: strange footprints burned into the earth, as if made by something impossibly heavy; a tree split down the middle, its core hollowed out and blackened; the remains of a squirrel’s nest, the twigs fused together by intense heat.

Pipkin took careful notes in his journal, sketching the patterns of the burns and the shape of the footprints. Grizelda collected samples—bits of metal, scorched bark, a pebble that glowed faintly when held up to the light.

They spoke little, each lost in their own thoughts. Pipkin remembered his training with Sir Reginald—how to stay calm in the face of danger, how to observe without being seen. He thought of his promise to protect the Citadel, and of the stories his mother used to tell him about brave rabbits who faced the unknown with courage.

By midday, their packs were heavy with samples and their minds heavy with worry. They retraced their steps, careful to leave no sign of their passing. The journey back to the Citadel felt longer than the journey out, every shadow seeming to harbor unseen threats.

When they finally reached the safety of the walls, Sir Reginald was waiting for them in the council chamber. The room was filled with the scent of old parchment and the soft glow of lanterns. Whisperwind, the wise old owl, perched on a high beam, observing with keen eyes. A few other knights lingered nearby, their faces drawn with concern.

Pipkin laid out their findings on the table: the metal shard, the glowing pebble, the sketches and notes. Grizelda recounted their encounter with the Starfall scout, her voice steady but urgent.

Sir Reginald listened intently, his brow furrowed. “This confirms Whisperwind’s warnings,” he said gravely. “The Starfall is real, and it’s closer than we thought. You two have done well. This information may be crucial in understanding what we’re facing.”

Whisperwind ruffled his feathers. “The Starfall’s scouts are clever, but not infallible. We must act quickly, before they learn too much about us.”

A murmur ran through the knights. Pipkin felt a surge of pride at having contributed, but also a deep, gnawing fear. The evidence was undeniable: something alien and dangerous had come to their world, and it was only a matter of time before it struck again.

Sir Reginald turned to Pipkin and Grizelda. “You have shown great courage today. But this is only the beginning. We must prepare the Citadel for what is to come. There will be more patrols, and we will need every pair of eyes and every brave heart.”

After the meeting, Pipkin and Grizelda sat together in the quiet of the courtyard, the weight of the day pressing down on them.

“Do you think we’re ready for this?” Pipkin asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Grizelda looked up at the stars beginning to appear above the treetops. “We have to be,” she said. “For the Citadel. For everyone.”

Pipkin nodded, drawing strength from her resolve. As night fell and the forest beyond the walls grew dark and mysterious once more, he vowed to face whatever came next with courage—and to stand by his friends, no matter how strange or frightening the days ahead might become.
