# Chapter 20: The Forest Patrol

The next morning, Sir Reginald assigned Pipkin and Grizelda to patrol the nearby forest. "The lights we've seen are not just random occurrences," he told them. "There are signs of something... unusual in the forest. I want you two to investigate."

Pipkin and Grizelda set out at dawn, their ears twitching with anticipation. The forest was quiet, the only sounds the rustling of leaves and the occasional bird call. They moved through the trees with practiced ease, their senses alert for any signs of trouble.

"Look!" Grizelda suddenly hissed, pointing ahead. "What's that?"

Pipkin squinted and saw what she meant - a strange metallic glint among the fallen leaves. They approached cautiously and found what looked like pieces of metal, unlike anything they had ever seen before. The metal was strange, with a faint blue glow that seemed to pulse softly.

"This is what Whisperwind was warning about," Pipkin whispered. "It's not natural."

As they continued their patrol, they found more signs of destruction - trees with strange burn marks, patches of scorched earth, and even a small crater where the ground seemed to have been melted.

"These aren't just accidents," Grizelda said, her voice filled with concern. "Something powerful is here."

They collected samples of the strange metal and took careful notes of their findings. When they returned to the Citadel, Sir Reginald listened intently to their report.

"This confirms Whisperwind's warnings," he said gravely. "The Starfall is real, and it's closer than we thought. You two have done well. This information may be crucial in understanding what we're facing."

Pipkin and Grizelda exchanged worried glances. They had seen evidence of something truly dangerous, and they knew they would need to be ready for whatever came next.
