# Chapter 23: The Squire's Duties

The morning sun had barely crested the castle walls when Pipkin found himself standing in the training yard, rubbing sleep from his eyes. The weight of his new squire's tabard—a deep emerald green with silver trim—still felt foreign on his shoulders. Three weeks had passed since the battle with the Starfall, and while the scars on the kingdom were healing, the memory of that day remained fresh in Pipkin's mind.

"Ah, Squire Pipkin!" Sir Reginald's voice boomed across the courtyard. The aging knight approached, his armor gleaming in the dawn light. "Ready for your first official day of training the new recruits?"

Pipkin swallowed hard, his ears twitching nervously. "Yes, Sir Reginald. Though I'm not entirely sure I'm ready to be teaching others."

Sir Reginald placed a heavy paw on Pipkin's shoulder. "That self-doubt? It's your greatest strength right now. The moment you think you know everything is the moment you stop growing." He leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Between you and me, I still learn something new every day."

As the first recruits began to filter into the training yard—a motley assortment of young animals from across the kingdom—Pipkin straightened his back. Among them was Grizelda, her gray fur neatly groomed, her expression a careful mask of determination.

"No, no, like this!" Pipkin demonstrated the basic defensive stance for what felt like the hundredth time that morning. He planted his feet shoulder-width apart, bending his knees slightly, his wooden practice sword held at the ready. "You want your weight evenly distributed, so you can move quickly in any direction."

A young fox named Tobin frowned, his tail twitching with frustration. "But when I do that, I feel off-balance."

Pipkin paused, remembering his own struggles with the same stance. He'd spent hours practicing in secret, falling over more times than he could count. "Here," he said, moving to Tobin's side. "May I?"

At the fox's nod, Pipkin gently adjusted his stance. "Try shifting your weight just a bit more to your back foot. And relax your shoulders—you're holding them up by your ears."

As Tobin adjusted his position, his eyes lit up. "Oh! That does feel better!"

From across the yard, Sir Reginald watched with a knowing smile before turning his attention to another group of recruits.

Lunch in the great hall was a raucous affair, with recruits from all corners of the kingdom sharing stories and laughter. Pipkin found an empty spot at a long wooden table, his muscles aching pleasantly from the morning's training.

"Mind if I join you?" Grizelda stood beside him, a wooden tray balanced carefully in her paws.

"Of course not!" Pipkin scooted over, making room. "How are you finding the training so far?" he asked as she sat down.

Grizelda took a thoughtful bite of bread before answering. "It's... different than I expected. I thought it would be all swordplay and glory, but there's so much more to it." She lowered her voice. "I never realized how much I relied on my size before. Now I have to actually think about strategy."

Pipkin nodded, remembering his own early lessons. "It's not just about being the biggest or the strongest. Sometimes, being small is an advantage. You can move in ways others can't."

As they ate, Pipkin found himself sharing stories of his own training—his many failures, the lessons learned from each defeat, and the mentors who had guided him along the way.

The afternoon session focused on the Knight's Code, and Pipkin found himself standing before a group of wide-eyed recruits, their faces turned up to him with expressions ranging from boredom to rapt attention.

"The Code isn't just a set of rules," Pipkin explained, pacing slowly before them. "It's a way of life. It's about more than just how to hold a sword or wear armor. It's about how we treat others, how we face challenges, and the kind of animals we choose to be."

A small hedgehog raised a quilled hand. "But what if following the Code puts you in danger? What if doing the right thing means you might get hurt?"

Pipkin was quiet for a moment, remembering the fear he'd felt facing the Starfall. "Then you do it anyway," he said softly. "Because being a knight isn't about never being afraid. It's about being afraid and doing what's right regardless."

As he spoke, he noticed Sir Reginald leaning against a pillar at the back of the room, his arms crossed, a look of quiet pride on his face.

As the sun began to set, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, Pipkin found himself alone in the training yard, practicing his forms. The rhythmic sound of wooden sword against practice dummy was the only sound in the quiet evening air.

"I thought I might find you here."

Pipkin turned to see Grizelda approaching, her own practice sword slung over her shoulder. "Couldn't sleep?" he asked.

She shook her head. "Too much to think about. Today was... eye-opening." She hesitated before continuing. "I wanted to thank you. For being patient with me. I know I haven't always been the easiest animal to get along with."

Pipkin smiled. "We all have our prickly moments. The important thing is that we keep growing, keep learning."

"We all grow when we help others," Grizelda said, echoing his earlier words. "That's what being a true knight is about, right?"

Pipkin felt a warmth spread through his chest as he realized how far they'd both come. "Exactly. Now, how about we practice those parries you were struggling with earlier?"

As the first stars began to appear in the darkening sky, the sound of wooden swords clashing and laughter filled the training yard—a promise of the knights they would one day become.
