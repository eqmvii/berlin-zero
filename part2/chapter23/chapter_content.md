# Chapter 23: The Squire's Duties

As a new squire, Pipkin found himself with more responsibilities than he had imagined. Sir Reginald assigned him to help train the new recruits, including mentoring Grizelda as she progressed through her own training.

"Remember," Sir Reginald said, "being a mentor is about more than just teaching skills. It's about passing on the values of knighthood."

Pipkin took his new role seriously. He worked with the recruits on both physical training and the principles of the Knight's Code. With Grizelda, he shared everything he had learned about strategy and observation.

"I never thought I'd be learning from you," Grizelda said one evening as they practiced sword forms. "But you've really grown, Pipkin."

"We all grow when we help others," Pipkin replied, remembering Sir Reginald's words. "That's what being a true knight is about."

As the days passed, Pipkin found that mentoring others helped him understand his own strengths and weaknesses better. He learned to lead by example and to be patient with those who were still learning.
