# Chapter 29: The Final Test

The Starfall launched its most massive attack yet - straight at the Citadel itself. Pipkin found himself facing his final test in the most unexpected way possible.

"Defend the Citadel!" Sir Reginald shouted as the ship's energy beams began to strike the walls. "Protect our home and our future!"

Pipkin took charge, organizing the squires into defensive positions. He used his knowledge of the Citadel's layout to create traps and defensive positions that would maximize their effectiveness.

"Remember what we learned!" he shouted to his companions. "Use your strengths!"

The battle was fierce, with the Starfall's technology pushing them to their limits. But Pipkin's quick thinking and strategic mind kept them one step ahead.

"We can do this!" he shouted, his voice filled with determination. "We've trained for this!"

As the attack intensified, Pipkin realized that this wasn't just a test of combat skills - it was a test of leadership, courage, and the values of knighthood they had all learned.

"Hold the line!" he called out. "For the Citadel, for our home, and for everything we believe in!"

The squires rallied around him, their determination matching his own. Together, they managed to hold off the attack long enough for reinforcements to arrive.

When the dust settled, Sir Reginald approached Pipkin. "You've proven yourself today," he said gravely. "Not just as a warrior, but as a true leader. You're ready for knighthood."
