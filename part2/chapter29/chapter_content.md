# Chapter 29: The Final Test

The Starfall launched its most massive attack yet—straight at the Citadel itself. It began as a distant tremor in the ground, a low hum that vibrated through the stone floors and ancient walls. Pipkin, standing atop the eastern rampart, felt the vibration in his bones before he saw the ship. The horizon glowed with an unnatural, shifting light, and then the Starfall appeared, descending from the clouds like a falling star, its hull bristling with alien energy.

For a heartbeat, the defenders of the Citadel stood frozen, awed by the scale of the threat. Then the first energy beams struck, searing the air and shattering the silence with a thunderous roar. Stone splintered and dust billowed as the walls shuddered under the assault.

"Defend the Citadel!" Sir Reginald’s voice rang out, cutting through the chaos. "Protect our home and our future!"

Pipkin’s heart hammered in his chest, but he forced himself to move. He remembered every lesson, every drill, every mistake and triumph that had brought him here. He darted down the battlements, ears flattened against his head as debris rained from above, and found the squires gathered in confusion near the armory.

"Positions!" Pipkin barked, his voice steadier than he felt. "We trained for this. Hazel, take the north gate. Clover, set up the oil traps by the western stairs. Bramble, you’re with me."

The squires snapped to action, galvanized by Pipkin’s certainty. He led Bramble through a narrow corridor, dodging falling stones. The Citadel’s labyrinthine passages, once a source of frustration in training, now became their greatest asset. Pipkin set traps—nets woven from wire, buckets of sand to smother fires, and makeshift barricades from overturned tables.

Outside, the night sky blazed with alien fire. The Starfall hovered above the Citadel, its engines howling. Mechanical drones poured from its belly, skittering across the ramparts, firing bolts of blue light. The defenders fought back with slings, spears, and whatever they could find.

Pipkin paused at a window, peering out at the chaos. The air was thick with smoke and the acrid scent of burning wood. He saw Hazel and her team holding the north gate, their faces grim but determined. A drone swooped low, scattering them, but Hazel stood her ground, hurling a stone that struck the drone’s sensor and sent it spiraling into the moat.

"Remember what we learned!" Pipkin shouted, his voice echoing through the halls. "Use your strengths! Work together!"

He raced to the central courtyard, where the fighting was fiercest. The Starfall’s beams had carved deep scars into the flagstones, and the defenders were pressed hard. Pipkin spotted Sir Reginald, sword flashing as he dueled a towering mechanical sentinel. The knight’s armor was scorched, his breath ragged, but his resolve was unbroken.

Pipkin’s mind raced. He remembered a hidden passage beneath the courtyard—a relic from the Citadel’s earliest days. If he could get a team through, they could flank the invaders. He grabbed Bramble and Clover, explaining his plan in hurried whispers. Together, they slipped into the shadows, moving swiftly and silently.

The passage was cramped and dark, the air thick with dust. Pipkin’s paws trembled, but he pressed on, leading his friends by memory and instinct. Above, the sounds of battle raged—cries of pain, the clash of metal, the whine of energy weapons.

They emerged behind enemy lines, in a storeroom now occupied by two drones. Pipkin signaled for silence. Bramble hurled a rock, distracting the machines, while Clover darted forward and cut their power cables with a swift slash. The drones collapsed, twitching.

"Good work," Pipkin whispered, pride swelling in his chest. "Now, let’s open the gate for the reinforcements."

They hurried to the gatehouse, dodging patrols and leaping over rubble. Pipkin’s paws ached, and his fur was singed in places, but he didn’t slow down. He remembered Sir Reginald’s words: A true knight never gives up, even when hope seems lost.

At the gatehouse, they found the controls jammed. Pipkin’s heart sank, but Bramble, ever resourceful, found a crowbar and together they forced the mechanism. The gate creaked open, and a cheer rose from the defenders outside. Reinforcements—rabbits, badgers, and even a few hedgehogs from the neighboring burrows—poured in, driving back the invaders.

The Starfall, sensing its advantage slipping, unleashed a final, desperate barrage. The sky turned white with energy, and the Citadel’s walls groaned under the onslaught. Pipkin felt the ground shake, saw the terror in his friends’ eyes.

"We can do this!" he shouted, planting himself in the breach. "We’ve trained for this! We fight for each other!"

The squires rallied around him. Hazel limped to his side, blood trickling from a cut on her ear. "We’re with you, Pipkin. To the end."

Clover nodded, gripping her staff. "For the Citadel. For our families."

Pipkin looked at each of them, seeing not just squires, but true companions—brave, loyal, and strong. He drew a deep breath, summoning every ounce of courage.

"Hold the line!" he called out, his voice ringing above the din. "For the Citadel, for our home, and for everything we believe in!"

The defenders locked arms, forming a living shield. The Starfall’s drones battered against them, but they held firm. Pipkin darted forward, disabling a drone with a well-placed kick. Hazel tripped another, and Clover smashed its core. The battle raged, but slowly, the tide turned.

At the height of the chaos, Pipkin glimpsed the Starfall’s command module, exposed for a moment as it recharged its main weapon. Seizing the chance, he signaled to Bramble, who hurled a grappling hook. Pipkin scrambled up the line, heart pounding, and reached the module. Inside, he found a bewildering array of alien controls.

He remembered the lessons from the Citadel’s scholars—about symbols, patterns, and logic. Trusting his instincts, Pipkin pressed a sequence of buttons. The Starfall shuddered, its lights flickering. With a final, earsplitting wail, the ship powered down, its drones collapsing across the battlefield.

A stunned silence fell. The defenders stared in disbelief as the Starfall drifted away, powerless. Slowly, cheers rose, growing louder until the Citadel echoed with victorious cries.

When the dust settled, Sir Reginald approached Pipkin, his armor dented but his eyes shining with pride. The squires gathered around, battered but triumphant.

"You’ve proven yourself today," Sir Reginald said gravely, placing a gauntleted paw on Pipkin’s shoulder. "Not just as a warrior, but as a true leader. You saw beyond fear, inspired your friends, and saved us all."

Pipkin’s throat tightened. He looked at his friends, at the Citadel he had fought so hard to defend, and felt a warmth blossom in his chest. He knelt as Sir Reginald drew his sword.

"By the power vested in me, and in the eyes of all who stand here, I name you Sir Pipkin, Knight of the Citadel."

The squires erupted in applause, and Pipkin rose, blinking back tears. The battle was over, but his journey had only just begun.

That night, as the Citadel’s fires were tended and the wounded cared for, Pipkin stood atop the ramparts, gazing at the stars. The Starfall was gone, but its shadow lingered. Pipkin knew that new challenges awaited, but he no longer faced them alone. He was a knight, a leader, and above all, a friend.

The Citadel would rebuild, stronger than before. And as dawn broke over the battered walls, Pipkin felt hope rising with the sun—a hope forged in the fire of the final test.
