# Chapter 27: The Plan

The smoke from the Starfall’s latest assault still hung low over the burrows, curling in the early morning light like ghostly fingers. The air was thick with the scent of scorched earth and the faint, metallic tang that always followed the alien ship’s attacks. Rabbits moved quietly through the warrens, tending to wounds—both physical and unseen. Pipkin stood at the edge of the council hollow, his fur matted with dust and his mind racing. He knew they could not endure another night like the last.

He gathered the squires—Grizelda, Thumper, and the others—beneath the battered roots of the old willow. The tree’s leaves trembled in the breeze, casting dappled shadows over the group. Pipkin’s voice, though tired, was steady. “We can’t just defend,” he said, his eyes sweeping over his companions. “If we keep waiting for the Starfall to strike, it’ll pick us apart. We need to understand what we’re facing—truly understand it.”

There was a moment of silence, broken only by the distant crackle of a burning thicket. Grizelda, the cleverest among them, shifted her satchel of notes and stepped forward. Her whiskers twitched as she spoke. “I’ve been watching the Starfall’s movements. They’re not random. Each attack is measured—almost like it’s testing us, probing for weaknesses.” She spread out a map, marked with tiny claw-scratches and colored stones. “Look. Each strike has come after we’ve changed our defenses. It’s learning from us.”

Thumper, broad-shouldered and still limping from a near-miss, nodded grimly. “It’s strong, but not invincible,” he said. “During the last attack, when it fired on the northern ridge, I saw the hull shimmer. There’s a spot—just above the glowing band—where the light flickers. Maybe a shield generator, or something like it.”

Pipkin knelt beside the map, tracing the Starfall’s path with a paw. “If it’s learning from us, we need to learn from it. Grizelda, can you predict its next move?”

She hesitated, ears drooping. “Maybe. I need more data. But if we could get closer, observe it directly—”

“Too risky,” interrupted a young squire, Twitch. His voice quavered, but his eyes were fierce. “The last scout barely made it back.”

Pipkin placed a reassuring paw on Twitch’s shoulder. “We’ll be careful. But we can’t afford to be blind.”

The group fell into a tense discussion, voices overlapping—some urgent, some fearful. Pipkin listened, weighing each idea. He saw the exhaustion in their eyes, the doubt gnawing at their resolve. Yet beneath it all, he sensed a spark—a stubborn hope that refused to die.

Grizelda unrolled a parchment filled with sketches of the Starfall. “If we could disrupt its sensors, even for a moment, we might get close enough to learn more. I’ve been working on a device—a sort of mirror, to scatter its beams.”

Thumper grunted approval. “And if we can draw its fire, maybe we can expose that weak spot again. I’ll lead a decoy team.”

Pipkin frowned, thinking. “We’ll need perfect timing. Grizelda, you and Twitch work on the mirror. Thumper, gather volunteers for the decoy. I’ll coordinate from the ridge.”

A hush fell as the plan took shape. Each rabbit knew their role, and though fear lingered, so did determination. Pipkin looked at each of them in turn. “We can’t win this alone. We have to trust each other—use our strengths to cover our weaknesses. That’s how we survive.”

He saw Grizelda’s nervous smile, Thumper’s resolute nod, Twitch’s trembling paws. Even the youngest squire, Daisy, stood a little taller. The plan was risky, perhaps even reckless. But it was better than waiting for the Starfall to strike again.

As the sun climbed higher, the squires dispersed to their tasks. Pipkin lingered by the willow, staring at the distant silhouette of the Starfall, which hovered like a dark omen on the horizon. He remembered the stories of old—of knights who faced monsters and impossible odds. He wondered if they had felt this same mix of fear and hope.

Grizelda returned first, her paws full of polished stones and shards of glass. “I think I can make the mirror work,” she said, her voice trembling with excitement. “If we position it on the ridge, it should scatter the Starfall’s scanning beams. But I’ll need help setting it up.”

Twitch volunteered, his earlier fear replaced by a quiet resolve. “I’ll help. I know those tunnels better than anyone.”

Meanwhile, Thumper drilled his decoy team, running them through maneuvers in the shadow of the old oak. “Remember,” he barked, “we’re not heroes. Our job is to draw its attention, not get ourselves caught.”

Pipkin moved between groups, offering encouragement and advice. He paused to help Daisy, who struggled with a bundle of wires for the mirror device. “You’re doing well,” he said gently. “Every small effort matters.”

Daisy looked up, her eyes wide. “Do you really think we can beat it?”

Pipkin hesitated, then nodded. “I think we have to try. That’s what makes us knights—not that we’re fearless, but that we act despite our fear.”

As dusk approached, the preparations neared completion. The mirror device gleamed atop the ridge, angled to catch the last rays of sunlight. The decoy team crouched in the tall grass, ready to spring into action. Grizelda and Twitch double-checked the wiring, their paws moving with practiced precision.

Pipkin called the group together one last time. “We know the risks. The Starfall is clever, and it won’t fall for the same trick twice. But tonight, we act as one. Watch for my signal. Trust each other.”

He looked at the faces around him—each marked by fear, but also by hope. He thought of the burrowers who depended on them, the elders who told stories of courage, the little ones who dreamed of peace. He felt the weight of their hopes settle on his shoulders, heavy but not crushing.

Night fell, and with it came silence. The Starfall pulsed on the horizon, its lights shifting in unnatural patterns. Pipkin crouched beside the mirror, heart pounding. He raised a paw, signaling Thumper’s team.

The decoys burst from cover, darting across the open field. The Starfall reacted instantly, beams of cold light sweeping the ground. The mirror caught the beams, scattering them in a dazzling display. For a moment, the ship hesitated—its sensors confused.

Grizelda whispered, “Now!”

Pipkin and Twitch darted forward, skirting the edge of the ship’s scanning field. They reached the base of the Starfall, hearts in their throats. Pipkin pressed a small device—one of Grizelda’s inventions—against the hull. It beeped softly, recording data.

Suddenly, the Starfall’s lights flared. An alarm blared, echoing across the fields. Pipkin grabbed Twitch, pulling him back. “Run!”

They raced for cover as the ship fired, earth exploding behind them. Thumper’s team drew the fire away, buying precious seconds. Pipkin and Twitch dove into a burrow, gasping for breath.

The Starfall hovered, searching, then slowly retreated—its sensors still scrambled by the mirror. When it finally vanished over the horizon, a cheer rose from the rabbits.

Back in the hollow, the squires gathered, battered but alive. Grizelda analyzed the data, her eyes shining. “We did it. We found a weakness—a real one. If we strike there, we might just have a chance.”

Pipkin smiled, exhaustion and relief mingling in his chest. “We acted as one. That’s our strength.”

As the first stars appeared overhead, the squires huddled together, hope blooming in the darkness. The plan had worked—tonight. Tomorrow, the real battle would begin.
