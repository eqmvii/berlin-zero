# Chapter 27: The Plan

In the aftermath of the attack, Pipkin gathered the squires to discuss their next move. "We can't just defend," he said. "We need to understand what we're facing."

Grizelda, who had been studying the Starfall's patterns, presented her findings. "They're methodical," she said. "Each attack seems designed to test our defenses and gather information."

Thumper added his observations about the ship's physical capabilities. "It's strong, but not invincible," he said. "We saw weak points during the attack."

Together, they began to formulate a plan - one that would combine immediate defense with gathering intelligence. Pipkin realized that their diverse skills would be crucial in facing this threat.

"We can't win this alone," he said. "We need to work together, using each other's strengths to make up for our weaknesses."

The plan they devised would require careful coordination and quick thinking. But Pipkin knew that if they worked as a team, they had a chance to turn the tide against the Starfall.
