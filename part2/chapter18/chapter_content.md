# Chapter 18: The First Test

The day of the formal combat test arrived like a storm cloud on the horizon. The training grounds were filled with tension as the trainees prepared for their assessments. Pipkin stood with Grizelda, both of them trying to appear calm despite their racing hearts.

"Today," Sir Reginald announced, his voice echoing across the courtyard, "you will face your first true test. Each of you will be paired against a more experienced trainee. This is not just a test of your skills, but of your character."

Pipkin's name was called first. He stepped forward to face his opponent - a massive rabbit named Boulder, who towered over him with muscles rippling beneath his fur. The other trainees watched in anticipation as Pipkin and Boulder took their positions.

"Begin!" Sir Reginald's voice rang out.

Boulder charged immediately, his wooden sword swinging in a powerful arc. Pipkin barely managed to parry the blow, feeling the impact shake his arms. He realized quickly that he couldn't match Boulder's strength.

But then he remembered something his father had taught him long ago - that sometimes the best defense is not to stand and fight, but to make your opponent fight the battlefield.

Instead of trying to block every blow, Pipkin began to use the training ground itself as his weapon. He darted between the practice dummies, using them as cover. He rolled under Boulder's sweeping strikes, turning the larger rabbit's momentum against him.

The spectators watched in amazement as Pipkin's strategy unfolded. He used Boulder's size against him, forcing the larger rabbit to constantly adjust his stance. Pipkin's quick strikes found gaps in Boulder's defense, each hit precise and controlled.

"What is this rabbit doing?" Thumper muttered to Grizelda. "He's not even trying to fight head-on!"

"That's exactly what he's doing," Grizelda replied with a grin. "He's making Boulder fight the field instead of him."

As the match continued, Pipkin's strategy became clear. He wasn't trying to overpower Boulder - he was trying to outthink him. Every time Boulder tried to corner him, Pipkin used his agility to slip away, always staying one step ahead.

Finally, Pipkin saw his opening. As Boulder swung wildly in frustration, Pipkin ducked under the blow and rolled to the side, coming up behind his opponent. With a quick, precise strike, he tapped Boulder's back - the traditional sign of a successful hit in training.

"Match!" Sir Reginald called. "Pipkin wins!"

The courtyard erupted in cheers. Pipkin had not only won the match but had done so using a strategy that none of the other trainees had considered.

"Well done, Pipkin," Sir Reginald said, his eyes shining with approval. "You've shown that a true knight uses all their gifts, not just their muscles. Your victory today proves that brains can indeed triumph over brawn."

As Pipkin walked back to his fellow trainees, he felt a mix of pride and relief. He had proven that he could hold his own against larger opponents, not through strength, but through clever tactics and quick thinking.

"I told you he was clever," Grizelda said with a smile.

"You did," Pipkin replied, still catching his breath. "But I couldn't have done it without remembering what my father taught me. Sometimes, the best way to win isn't to fight harder, but to fight smarter."
