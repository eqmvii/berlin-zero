# Chapter 30: The Knight's Dawn

The day of Pipkin's knighting ceremony arrived with a solemn air. The great hall of the Citadel was filled with the kingdom's leaders, all gathered to witness this momentous occasion.

Sir Reginald stood before Pipkin, his voice carrying authority and pride. "Today, we honor a rabbit who has shown exceptional courage, wisdom, and leadership. Pipkin, kneel before me."

Pipkin knelt, his heart pounding with a mix of excitement and responsibility. Sir Reginald placed a gleaming sword in his hands - a sword forged from the very metal they had recovered from the Starfall outpost.

"Rise, Sir Pipkin," Sir Reginald said, his voice ringing with pride. "You are now a knight of the Citadel, bound by the Knight's Code to protect the innocent and defend our world."

The hall erupted in cheers as Pipkin stood, his new armor gleaming in the light. He felt the weight of his responsibilities, but also a sense of purpose he had never known before.

"Your first quest awaits," Lady Elara said, stepping forward. "The Starfall threat grows stronger. We need you to lead a mission to gather more intelligence about their plans."

Pipkin nodded, his ears standing tall with determination. "I'm ready," he said. "For the kingdom, and for everything we believe in."

As he left the Citadel that day, Pipkin felt a sense of destiny settling over him. He was no longer just a squire or a trainee - he was a knight, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
