# Chapter 17: The Knight's Code

The next morning dawned crisp and golden, sunlight streaming through the high arched windows of the Citadel’s great hall. The air buzzed with anticipation as dozens of young rabbits assembled, their fur brushed and armor polished, ears quivering with excitement and nerves. Pipkin stood among them, his heart pounding so loudly he wondered if those beside him could hear it. He glanced around at the sea of faces—some familiar, some new, all eager to prove themselves.

Sir Reginald entered with a commanding presence, his cloak trailing behind him, silver whiskers glinting in the morning light. The room fell silent at once, every eye fixed on the legendary knight. Pipkin straightened his back, determined to appear brave, though his paws fidgeted at his sides.

“Today,” Sir Reginald began, his voice deep and resonant, “we begin the true heart of your training—the Knight’s Code. Many of you have trained your bodies, learned to wield a sword or nock an arrow, but this—” he tapped his chest, “—is where a true knight is forged.”

He paced slowly down the rows of trainees, his gaze steady and searching. “The Code is not merely a list of rules. It is a way of life. It is what separates a mere soldier from a true knight. It is what makes you worthy of the title you seek.”

Pipkin felt a hush settle over the hall, as if the very stones were listening. Sir Reginald’s words seemed to echo in the vaulted ceiling, weighty and ancient.

“First,” the knight intoned, “we protect the innocent. No matter their size or strength, every creature under our protection is equal in our eyes. We stand between them and harm, no matter the cost.”

He paused, looking directly at Pipkin, who felt a shiver run down his spine. “I have seen the smallest among us perform the greatest acts of courage. Never doubt that your size limits your valor.”

“Second, we serve with honor. Our word is our bond. When we make a promise, we keep it. When we make a mistake, we own it. Our honor is our most precious possession. Lose it, and you lose yourself.”

Sir Reginald’s gaze swept the room, lingering on the faces of those who looked away. “There was a time, many seasons ago, when I failed to keep a promise. The shame of it weighed heavier than any armor. But I learned—honor can be restored, if you face your faults with honesty.”

“Third, we lead by example. Whether in battle or in peace, we set the standard for others to follow. Our actions speak louder than our words. A true knight inspires others to greatness.”

He stopped before the youngest trainee, a trembling kit, and knelt. “You may think you have little to offer. But courage is not the absence of fear—it is the will to act in spite of it.”

As Sir Reginald finished, a reverent silence hung in the air. Pipkin felt the weight of the Code settle onto his shoulders, heavier than any shield. He realized that being a knight was about more than fighting—it was about being a force for good, a beacon in the darkness.

The lesson ended, but the words lingered in Pipkin’s mind as the trainees filed out into the training yard. Today’s exercises, Sir Reginald announced, would be conducted in pairs. Pipkin found himself partnered with a young rabbit he had seen practicing archery in the evenings—a small, sturdy doe named Grizelda. Her fur was the color of autumn leaves, and her eyes shone with quiet determination.

“So, you’re Pipkin?” Grizelda asked, her voice surprisingly deep for her size. She adjusted the strap of her quiver, glancing at him sidelong. “I’ve heard you’re good at thinking on your feet.”

Pipkin blushed, rubbing the back of his neck. “I do my best. I’ve seen you hit the bullseye from halfway across the range.”

Grizelda grinned. “It’s all in the ears. You can hear the wind change if you listen close enough.”

Before they could say more, Sir Reginald called them to attention. Today’s challenge was a mock rescue mission: each pair would navigate a course filled with obstacles, traps, and “villagers” (represented by wooden targets) in need of saving. The course wound through the orchard, over fallen logs, beneath thorny hedges, and across a shallow stream. The first pair to complete the mission with all their villagers safe would earn a place of honor at the evening meal.

Pipkin and Grizelda sized up the course together. “You take the lead on spotting traps,” Pipkin suggested. “I’ll clear the path and distract the ‘bandits’.”

Grizelda nodded, eyes sharp. “Deal. And if we get separated—meet by the old oak.”

The whistle blew, and they were off. Pipkin darted forward, nimble as a breeze, leaping over brambles and weaving between obstacles. Grizelda moved with silent precision, her keen eyes catching the glint of a hidden wire or the shadow of a tripline. When they reached a narrow bridge, Pipkin paused, testing the boards with his paw. “Rotten,” he whispered. Grizelda pointed to a safer crossing, and together they guided their first “villager” to safety.

Halfway through, they encountered a mock ambush—two older trainees playing the part of bandits. Pipkin feinted left, drawing their attention, while Grizelda slipped behind and “rescued” the target. They exchanged a quick grin, exhilarated by their teamwork.

As they neared the finish, Pipkin stumbled, nearly falling into a cleverly disguised pit. Grizelda caught his paw, steadying him. “Watch your step, Sir Knight,” she teased.

“Thank you, Lady Archer,” he replied, grinning.

They reached the final obstacle—a high wall, too tall for either to climb alone. Pipkin crouched, bracing himself. “Step on my back. I’ll boost you up.” Grizelda hesitated, then nodded, scrambling onto his shoulders and pulling herself up. She reached down, grasping his paws, and together they tumbled over, landing in a heap on the other side, laughing breathlessly.

They completed the mission faster than any other pair, all their villagers safe. Sir Reginald met them at the finish, his eyes twinkling with approval. “Well done, you two. You show the true spirit of knighthood. Together, you complement each other’s strengths. That’s what makes a great team.”

As the sun set and shadows lengthened across the Citadel, Pipkin and Grizelda walked back to their quarters. The day’s excitement had faded into a comfortable tiredness, and their conversation flowed easily.

“I never thought I’d find someone here who understands what it’s like to be small in a world of big rabbits,” Pipkin admitted, his voice soft.

Grizelda smiled, her ears drooping with fatigue. “Me neither. But you know what? The stories never say how big the knights were. They just say how brave they were.”

They paused at a window overlooking the training grounds, watching the last rays of sunlight gild the grass. “Do you ever get scared?” Pipkin asked quietly.

“All the time,” Grizelda replied. “But I remember what my grandmother used to say: ‘Bravery isn’t about not being afraid. It’s about doing what’s right, even when you are.’”

Pipkin nodded, feeling a sense of kinship with his new friend. “I used to think I had to be the strongest or the fastest to matter. But today…I think maybe it’s enough to try. To help. To live by the Code.”

Grizelda touched his paw. “That’s all any of us can do.”

As they parted for the night, Pipkin looked back at the great hall, glowing softly in the moonlight. The Knight’s Code wasn’t just something to memorize—it was something to live by, every day, in every choice. And with friends like Grizelda beside him, Pipkin felt ready to face whatever challenges the Citadel—or the world—might bring.
