# Chapter 17: The Knight's Code

The next morning, Sir Reginald gathered all the trainees in the great hall. The room was filled with the expectant silence of young rabbits, their ears twitching with anticipation. Pipkin stood among them, his heart pounding with a mix of excitement and nervousness.

"Today," Sir Reginald began, his voice carrying authority, "we begin the true heart of your training - learning the Knight's Code. A knight is more than just a warrior. A knight is a protector, a defender of the weak, and a guardian of justice."

He walked slowly down the rows of trainees, his eyes meeting each one in turn. "The Code is not just a set of rules. It is a way of life. It is what separates a mere soldier from a true knight."

Pipkin listened intently as Sir Reginald began to recite the principles of knighthood:

"First, we protect the innocent. No matter their size or strength, every creature under our protection is equal in our eyes. We stand between them and harm, no matter the cost."

"Second, we serve with honor. Our word is our bond. When we make a promise, we keep it. When we make a mistake, we own it. Our honor is our most precious possession."

"Third, we lead by example. Whether in battle or in peace, we set the standard for others to follow. Our actions speak louder than our words."

As Sir Reginald spoke, Pipkin felt the weight of these principles settling on his shoulders. He realized that being a knight was about more than just fighting - it was about being a force for good in the world.

After the lesson, Pipkin found himself paired with a young rabbit named Grizelda for their training exercises. Grizelda was smaller than most of the other trainees, but her ears stood tall with determination. She moved with a grace that belied her size.

"So, you're Pipkin?" Grizelda asked, her voice surprisingly deep for her size. "I've heard about your clever fighting style."

"And you must be Grizelda," Pipkin replied with a smile. "I've seen you practicing your archery. You're quite skilled."

Their conversation was interrupted by Sir Reginald's next assignment - a mock rescue mission. The trainees were to work in pairs to rescue "villagers" (represented by wooden targets) from a series of obstacles.

Pipkin and Grizelda worked together seamlessly. While Pipkin used his agility to clear the way, Grizelda's keen eyes spotted hidden dangers and planned their route. They completed the mission faster than any other pair, earning praise from Sir Reginald.

"Well done, you two," the instructor said, his eyes twinkling with approval. "You show the true spirit of knighthood. Together, you complement each other's strengths. That's what makes a great team."

As they walked back to their quarters that evening, Pipkin and Grizelda fell into easy conversation. They discovered they both came from small villages and shared a love of stories about legendary knights.

"I never thought I'd find someone here who understands what it's like to be small in a world of big rabbits," Pipkin said, his voice soft.

Grizelda smiled. "Me neither. But you know what? The stories never say how big the knights were. They just say how brave they were."

Pipkin nodded, feeling a sense of kinship with this new friend. Together, they would face whatever challenges the Citadel threw their way. The Knight's Code wasn't just something to memorize - it was something to live by, every day.
