# Chapter 22: The Squire's Test

The day of Pipkin's squire test arrived. The courtyard was filled with trainees and instructors, all watching intently as Pipkin stood before Sir Reginald.

"Today," the instructor began, "you must prove yourself not just as a warrior, but as a leader. You will face challenges that test your mind as well as your body."

The test was unlike anything Pipkin had faced before. First, he had to solve complex tactical puzzles that required quick thinking and strategic planning. Then, he had to lead a group of trainees through a simulated rescue mission, making decisions that affected their success.

The final challenge was the most difficult. Pipkin was presented with a scenario where he had to choose between two equally important tasks - save a village from an immediate threat or gather crucial intelligence about the Starfall.

"What would you do?" Sir Reginald asked, his eyes searching Pipkin's face.

Pipkin thought carefully, remembering all he had learned about leadership and duty. "I would divide my resources," he said finally. "Send a small team to gather intelligence while leading the main force to protect the village. That way, we don't neglect either responsibility."

Sir Reginald nodded slowly. "You show wisdom beyond your years, Pipkin. You understand that sometimes the hardest part of leadership is making difficult choices."

As the test concluded, Pipkin felt a sense of accomplishment mixed with humility. He had proven himself ready for the responsibilities of a squire, but he knew the real test would come when facing the Starfall threat.
