# Chapter 25: The Council of Elders

Pipkin was summoned to a secret meeting in the Citadel's deepest chambers. The room was filled with the kingdom's most respected leaders - Sir Reginald, Lady Elara, and several others he had never seen before.

"Pipkin," Sir Reginald began, "we have gathered to discuss the Starfall threat. But first, we must tell you something important."

One of the elders, an ancient rabbit with fur as white as snow, spoke next. "Long ago, before your great-grandparents were born, there was another Starfall. It was defeated by a small band of heroes who used clever tactics rather than brute strength."

Pipkin's ears perked up. "You mean... like me?"

The elder nodded. "Exactly. The Starfall is not just a threat - it's a test. A test of our values, our wisdom, and our ability to work together."

The council revealed ancient texts and diagrams showing how the previous Starfall had been defeated through clever strategies and alliances. Pipkin realized that his size and agility, which he had once seen as weaknesses, might actually be strengths against this new threat.

"You have a unique role to play," Lady Elara said. "Not just as a warrior, but as someone who can see solutions others might miss."
