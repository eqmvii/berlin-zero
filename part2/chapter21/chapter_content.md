# Chapter 21: The Diplomatic Mission

The next morning, Pipkin was summoned to Sir Reginald's chambers. "You're coming with us on a diplomatic mission," the instructor said, his voice serious. "We need to speak with the neighboring kingdom about the Starfall threat."

Pipkin's heart raced with excitement and nervousness. He would be representing the Citadel in official matters - a responsibility he hadn't expected.

The journey to the neighboring kingdom was long but enlightening. Along the way, Sir Reginald taught Pipkin about the art of diplomacy - how to listen carefully, how to choose words wisely, and how to read between the lines.

When they arrived at the neighboring kingdom, Pipkin was amazed by its grandeur. The castle was even larger than the Citadel, its walls gleaming in the sunlight.

"Welcome, Sir Reginald," said Lady Elara, the kingdom's representative. "And who is this young rabbit?"

"This is Pipkin," Sir Reginald replied. "He's shown great promise and keen insight into the Starfall situation."

The diplomatic talks were tense but productive. Pipkin watched as Sir Reginald and Lady Elara navigated complex political waters, making alliances and sharing information about the strange metallic debris they'd found.

"You see, Pipkin," Sir Reginald explained later, "being a knight isn't just about fighting. Sometimes, the most important battles are won with words and alliances."

Pipkin nodded, realizing that the coming threat would require more than just physical strength - it would require unity and cooperation among all the kingdoms.
