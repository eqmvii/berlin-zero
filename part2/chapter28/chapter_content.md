# Chapter 28: The First Victory

Pipkin led a small team on a daring raid against one of the Starfall's outposts - a strange metallic structure they had discovered in a remote forest. Using the plan they had devised, they approached the outpost with stealth and precision.

Grizelda's keen eyes spotted the outpost's weak points, while Thumper's strength helped them breach its defenses. Pipkin used his agility to navigate the complex interior, avoiding the ship's automated defenses.

"This is it!" Grizelda shouted, pointing to a strange device that seemed to be analyzing the surrounding environment.

Pipkin quickly disabled the device, knowing it was crucial to the Starfall's operations. As they retreated, they gathered valuable data about the ship's technology.

"We did it!" Thumper said, his voice filled with pride.

"Yes," Pipkin replied, "but this is just the beginning. We've learned what we need to know to fight back effectively."
