# Chapter 24: The Gathering Storm

The first report came from the village of Thistlebrook, a small hamlet known for its rich carrot fields. The message had arrived just after dawn, carried by a panting messenger rabbit who had fallen to his knees before Sir Reginald's feet.

"Beams of light, Sir!" the rabbit had gasped. "They came from the sky and... and..." His voice had cracked as he described the destruction.

Since then, the reports had come thick and fast. From the northern wheat fields to the southern meadows, villages across the kingdom were reporting strange occurrences that defied explanation. Crops burned in precise circles, animals found with strange wounds that glowed faintly in the dark, and metallic fragments scattered like fallen stars.

"This is serious," Sir Reginald had said, his voice grave as he pinned the map to the war room wall. "Pipkin, Grizelda, Thumper - you three are our best hope. Find out what's happening."

The journey to Bramblewood village took most of the day, the three friends traveling at a brisk pace through the rolling countryside. Pipkin led the way, his ears twitching constantly as he listened for any sign of danger. Grizelda walked beside him, her eyes scanning the horizon, while Thumper brought up the rear, his long ears drooping with concern.

As they approached the village, the first signs of the attack became visible. A barn stood partially collapsed, its wooden beams blackened and twisted. The air carried a faint metallic scent, like iron heated in a forge.

"This way," a village elder called out, leading them to the central square where several injured rabbits lay on makeshift beds of hay and leaves. The wounds were unlike anything Pipkin had seen - clean burns that seemed to have been cut rather than burned.

"They came from the sky," one of the injured rabbits whispered, her voice weak but clear. "Like stars falling, but not stars. They moved... they moved like they had minds of their own."

Pipkin knelt beside her, his mind racing. "Can you describe them? What did they look like?"

The rabbit closed her eyes, concentrating. "They were... silver. Like the moon, but brighter. And they made no sound. Just... just light."

In the village square, Pipkin found what he had been searching for - a fragment of metal, about the size of his paw, lying half-buried in the dirt. He picked it up carefully, feeling its strange, cool weight.

"This isn't natural," he said, turning it over in his paws. "It's... engineered."

Grizelda joined him, her eyes narrowing as she examined the fragment. "Look at this - there are patterns etched into it. Not random, but..." She hesitated. "Like writing, but not any writing I've ever seen."

"The Starfall," Thumper said softly, his voice trembling. "It's here."

Pipkin nodded slowly. "Not all of it. Not yet. But... scouts. Probes. They're testing us."

---

As night fell, the three friends gathered around a small campfire on the edge of the village. The air was cool, carrying the scent of wood smoke and damp earth. Pipkin held up the metallic fragment, studying it in the flickering light.

"They're learning," he said, his voice quiet but firm. "The burn marks - they're precise. Too precise to be random attacks. They're testing our defenses, our reactions."

Grizelda nodded, her ears twitching nervously. "And they're not just attacking the strong ones. They're targeting the weak - the villages, the fields. They're trying to break us down, piece by piece."

"But why?" Thumper asked, his voice barely above a whisper. "Why not just attack all at once?"

Pipkin's eyes narrowed. "Because they want us scared. They want us to fight among ourselves. They want us to doubt our strength."

He stood up, the fragment still clutched in his paw. "We need to warn the others. But we also need to learn. We need to understand their technology."

---

The next morning, they set out for the nearest village, spreading the warning as they went. Pipkin took careful notes of each attack - the patterns, the timing, the locations. He began to see a pattern emerging - the probes were systematically testing different types of terrain, different types of defenses.

"They're mapping us," he said to Grizelda as they paused for a quick meal. "Not just our land, but our minds. They want to know how we think, how we react."

"Then we need to change how we react," Grizelda replied, her eyes flashing with determination. "We need to show them we're not predictable."

---

By the time they returned to the castle, Pipkin had filled several pages with observations and theories. He presented them to Sir Reginald, his voice steady despite the fear that gnawed at his insides.

"The Starfall isn't just coming," he said. "It's already here. But it's not what we thought. It's not a single attack, but a thousand small ones. A thousand ways to break us apart."

Sir Reginald listened in silence, his eyes distant as he considered the implications.

"And what do you suggest?" he asked finally.

Pipkin took a deep breath. "We need to strengthen our defenses, yes. But more importantly, we need to strengthen our unity. We need to show them that we're more than just individuals - we're a kingdom."

---

That night, Pipkin sat alone in his quarters, the metallic fragment still clutched in his paw. He traced the strange patterns etched into its surface, his mind racing with possibilities.

"We're not just fighting a war," he whispered to himself. "We're fighting for our way of life. For who we are."

Outside, the stars shone brightly in the night sky - beautiful, distant, and utterly indifferent to the struggle below. But Pipkin knew that not all the lights in the sky were stars.

And he knew that the fight was just beginning.
