# Chapter 24: The Gathering Storm

Reports of strange occurrences began pouring in from across the kingdom - villages attacked by unknown forces, strange metallic objects found in fields, and sightings of lights in the sky that moved with purpose.

Pipkin, Grizelda, and Thumper were sent to investigate one of the most serious incidents - an attack on a remote village where several rabbits had been injured by what witnesses described as "beams of light."

When they arrived, they found evidence of advanced technology - metallic fragments that glowed faintly, burn marks that seemed to have been made by intense heat, and patterns in the destruction that suggested precision rather than random violence.

"This is worse than we thought," Pipkin said, examining a piece of strange metal. "The Starfall isn't just coming - it's already here, in small ways."

As they gathered evidence and interviewed witnesses, Pipkin began to see patterns in the attacks. The Starfall wasn't just attacking randomly - it was testing, learning about their world and its defenses.

"We need to warn the other villages," Grizelda said urgently. "They need to know what they're facing."

Pipkin nodded. "And we need to learn more about this technology. It's unlike anything we've seen before."
