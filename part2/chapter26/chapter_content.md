# Chapter 26: The First Contact

The attack came without warning. One moment, the sky was clear; the next, a massive ship descended from the clouds, its metallic hull gleaming in the sunlight. Pipkin and his companions watched in horror as the Starfall began its first major attack on the kingdom.

"Form up!" Pipkin shouted, remembering his training. "We need to protect the civilians!"

The team sprang into action. Pipkin used his agility to dodge the ship's energy beams while Grizelda's quick thinking helped them find cover. Thumper's strength proved invaluable in moving obstacles and protecting others.

As they fought to defend the citizens, Pipkin noticed something strange - the ship seemed to be testing their defenses, studying their reactions. He realized they needed to gather intelligence about the Starfall's capabilities while protecting their people.

"We need to observe their patterns," Pipkin told his companions. "This isn't just an attack - it's a learning exercise for them."

The battle raged on, but Pipkin and his team managed to protect the civilians while also collecting valuable information about the Starfall's technology and tactics.
