# Chapter 26: The First Contact

The attack came without warning. One moment, the sky was a serene blue, dotted with lazy clouds and the distant shapes of birds; the next, the heavens split open with a thunderous roar. From the breach, a massive ship descended, its metallic hull gleaming with an otherworldly sheen that caught the sunlight and fractured it into a thousand shards across the city below. The Starfall had arrived.

Pipkin stood frozen, his heart pounding in his chest as the shadow of the ship swept over the kingdom’s capital. Around him, the market square erupted into chaos. Stalls were overturned, baskets of fruit and vegetables scattered, and the air filled with the shrieks of frightened animals and the panicked cries of citizens.

Beside him, Grizelda’s fur bristled. “Pipkin, look at the size of it!” she gasped, eyes wide. Even Thumper, usually unflappable, took a step back, his ears pressed flat against his skull.

A low, mechanical hum vibrated through the ground, rattling Pipkin’s bones. The Starfall hovered, impossibly silent for its size, before a hatch opened on its underside. From within, beams of searing light shot downward, carving burning lines into the cobblestones where moments before children had been playing.

“Form up!” Pipkin shouted, snapping out of his stupor. His training surged to the forefront of his mind, every lesson drilled into him by the knights echoing in his memory. “We need to protect the civilians! Grizelda, Thumper—on me!”

The team sprang into action. Pipkin darted through the panicked crowd, guiding a group of young leverets toward the shelter of a stone archway. Grizelda, quick-witted and nimble, spotted a cluster of elders struggling to move and dashed to their aid, urging them toward safety. Thumper’s powerful legs sent him bounding across the square, shoving aside toppled carts and forming a barricade with whatever debris he could find.

Above, the Starfall’s hull shifted. Panels slid open to reveal an array of strange, glimmering devices. Pipkin’s breath caught as he watched one of the devices emit a pulse of blue energy. It struck the ground with a crackling sizzle, leaving a smoldering crater in its wake.

“Stay low!” Pipkin called, ushering the last of the children into cover. He glanced up, searching for any sign of the ship’s intent. The Starfall’s movements were deliberate, almost curious. It could have razed the entire square in seconds, yet it seemed to be holding back, firing only at intervals, never targeting the same place twice.

Grizelda slid in beside him, panting. “They’re not aiming to destroy us,” she said, voice trembling. “It’s like they’re… testing us.”

Pipkin nodded, his mind racing. “We need to learn as much as we can. Watch how it moves, how it chooses its targets.”

Thumper joined them, his fur singed in places but his eyes fierce. “I saw something,” he grunted. “Each time someone fights back—throws a stone, swings a stick—the ship pauses. It’s watching.”

The realization dawned on Pipkin like a cold dawn. “It’s studying us. Learning how we defend ourselves.”

A sudden scream split the air. Across the square, a family was trapped beneath a collapsed awning, the fabric smoldering where an energy beam had struck. Pipkin didn’t hesitate. “Cover me!” he barked, sprinting toward the wreckage.

Grizelda and Thumper moved to flank him, drawing the ship’s attention with shouts and thrown debris. Pipkin ducked low, using the chaos as cover. He reached the family—a mother rabbit and her two kits—just as another beam lanced down, narrowly missing them.

“It’s all right,” Pipkin soothed, helping them up. “Follow me, quickly!”

He led them back to the archway, heart pounding. Every instinct screamed at him to run, but he forced himself to stay calm. He needed to think, to observe.

The Starfall shifted again, its hull rippling with strange lights. Pipkin squinted, trying to make sense of the patterns. Was there a logic to its attacks? A rhythm?

Suddenly, a new threat emerged. From the ship’s belly, small metallic spheres dropped to the ground, unfolding into spindly-legged drones. They skittered across the cobblestones, their single red eyes scanning for movement.

“Drones!” Grizelda shouted. “They’re herding us!”

Pipkin watched as the drones pressed the crowd into tighter clusters, driving them toward the center of the square. The Starfall’s beams now targeted the periphery, cutting off escape routes but never striking the civilians directly.

“They want us together,” Thumper growled. “Easier to study. Or capture.”

Pipkin’s mind raced. “We can’t let them control the field. Grizelda, start a diversion on the east side. Thumper, help me clear a path through the barricade. We’ll get as many out as we can.”

Grizelda nodded, determination hardening her features. She darted toward the eastern edge, tossing stones and shouting taunts to draw the drones’ attention. Several peeled off, chasing her. Thumper and Pipkin worked together, heaving aside debris and guiding frightened citizens through the gap.

As they worked, Pipkin kept one eye on the Starfall. He noted the way its lights flickered in response to resistance, the way its drones adapted to new threats. Every detail was precious.

A sudden explosion rocked the square. Pipkin was thrown to the ground, ears ringing. When he looked up, he saw a group of young rabbits—students from the academy—standing defiantly atop a pile of rubble, slingshots in hand. They fired at the drones, forcing them back.

Pipkin scrambled to his feet and joined them. “Good work!” he called. “Aim for their legs—slow them down!”

Together, they managed to disable several drones, buying precious seconds for others to escape. But the Starfall responded, sending a fresh wave of drones and intensifying its beams.

“We can’t hold them off forever,” Grizelda shouted, rejoining the group. “We need a plan!”

Pipkin’s mind whirled. “We need to get someone close to the ship. If we can plant a marker, we might be able to track its movements, learn more about its technology.”

Thumper grinned, baring his teeth. “I’ll do it. I’m the fastest.”

“No,” Pipkin said, shaking his head. “You’re needed here. I’ll go.”

He slipped away, moving from cover to cover, heart hammering in his chest. The Starfall loomed above, its presence oppressive. Pipkin crept closer, feeling the heat of its engines, the electric tingle of its shields.

He reached the base of the ship, planting a small device—one of Grizelda’s inventions—against the hull. As he did, a drone spotted him, emitting a shrill alarm. Pipkin bolted, zigzagging through the chaos as beams of light scorched the ground behind him.

He dove behind a fallen statue, gasping for breath. The device was in place. Now they just had to survive.

The Starfall began to withdraw, its drones retreating and beams ceasing. The ship rose higher, its hull shimmering as it disappeared into the clouds. The square was left in ruins, but the people had survived.

Pipkin regrouped with his friends, exhaustion etched into every line of his face. Grizelda hugged him tightly, and even Thumper managed a weary smile.

“We did it,” Pipkin said, voice hoarse. “We protected them. And we learned something.”

Grizelda nodded. “We’ll be ready next time.”

As the sun set, casting long shadows across the battered city, Pipkin looked up at the sky. The Starfall would return. But so would they. And next time, they would not be caught unprepared.
