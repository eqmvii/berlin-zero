# Chapter 14: The Knight's Promise

The mood at the keep was solemn as Sir Reginald called a gathering in the great hall. Pipkin stood before the assembled knights and apprentices, his heart pounding.

“Pipkin,” Sir Reginald intoned, “do you swear to uphold the Knight’s Code and defend the realm, no matter the cost?”

Pipkin bowed his head. “I swear it, on my life and honor.”

Hazel stepped forward, her voice clear. “And I promise to stand by Pipkin, to support him in every quest.”

The hall erupted in cheers. Sir Reginald placed a ceremonial cloak over Pipkin’s shoulders. “You are no longer just an apprentice. Today, you become a knight-in-training.”

The celebration that followed was filled with laughter, music, and stories of old. But beneath the joy, Pipkin felt the weight of his promise. The Starfall was coming, and he had vowed to stand against it.

That night, Pipkin and Hazel sat together, watching the stars. “Whatever comes, we face it together,” Hazel whispered.

Pipkin nodded, hope and fear mingling in his heart. He was ready for whatever the future held.
