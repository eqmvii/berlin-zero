# Chapter 14: The Knight's Promise

The mood at the keep was solemn as Sir Reginald called a gathering in the great hall. Banners hung from the rafters, their colors muted in the candlelight. Knights, apprentices, and townsfolk filled the hall, their faces expectant and serious. Pipkin stood at the center, his heart pounding like a drum in his chest.

Sir Reginald’s voice echoed through the hall. “Pipkin, step forward.”

Pipkin swallowed hard and moved to stand before the old knight. Sir Reginald’s eyes were kind but piercing. “Do you swear to uphold the Knight’s Code and defend the realm, no matter the cost?”

Pipkin bowed his head, his voice steady despite the tremor in his paws. “I swear it, on my life and honor.”

Hazel stepped forward, her voice clear and unwavering. “And I promise to stand by Pipkin, to support him in every quest, no matter the danger.”

A hush fell over the hall. For a moment, all Pipkin could hear was the crackle of the fire and the distant sound of rain against the windows. Then Sir Reginald lifted a ceremonial cloak, deep blue with silver embroidery, and draped it over Pipkin’s shoulders. “You are no longer just an apprentice. Today, you become a knight-in-training.”

The hall erupted in cheers. Knights stomped their feet, apprentices clapped, and Lady Elara played a triumphant tune on her lute. Grizelda, the gruff captain, gave Pipkin a rare nod of approval. Pipkin’s cheeks burned with pride and humility.

The celebration that followed was filled with laughter, music, and stories of old. Tables groaned under the weight of fresh bread, sweet berries, and steaming stews. Pipkin and Hazel were swept into dances, their worries forgotten for a time. Friends toasted to Pipkin’s future, and even the shyest kit offered a flower or a kind word.

But beneath the joy, Pipkin felt the weight of his promise. Each time he caught Hazel’s eye, he saw the same mix of hope and worry reflected back at him. The Starfall was coming, and he had vowed to stand against it—not just for himself, but for everyone he loved.

Later, as the hall emptied and the fire burned low, Pipkin slipped away to the quiet of the courtyard. Hazel found him there, gazing up at the stars.

“Do you think we’re ready for what’s coming?” Pipkin asked softly.

Hazel took his paw. “We may never be ready. But we’ll face it together. That’s what matters.”

They sat in silence, the night air cool and bracing. Pipkin thought of all he had learned—the trials, the vision, the promise he had just made. The responsibility felt immense, but so did his determination.

Sir Reginald joined them, his steps slow but sure. “A knight’s promise is a beacon in the darkness,” he said. “Hold fast to it, and you will find your way—even when the path is unclear.”

Hazel squeezed Pipkin’s paw. “We’ll light the way together.”

Pipkin smiled, hope and fear mingling in his heart. He was ready for whatever the future held.
