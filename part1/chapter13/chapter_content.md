# Chapter 13: The Knight's Vision

After the trials, Sir Reginald introduced Pipkin to the ancient practice of meditation. “A knight must see beyond what is before his eyes,” he said. “Close your eyes, breathe, and listen.”

Pipkin sat in the quiet garden, the world falling away. As he drifted deeper, a strange vision took hold: He saw a sky streaked with fire, a great shadow falling over the land, and a voice whispering his name. He glimpsed the silhouette of a ship—unlike any bird or beast—descending from the heavens.

He awoke with a gasp, heart pounding. Hazel was at his side, concern in her eyes. “What did you see?”

Pipkin struggled to explain. “Something is coming. Something from beyond our world.”

Sir Reginald listened carefully. “You have been touched by a greater destiny, Pipkin. The Starfall is not just a legend. It is real—and you may be the one to face it.”

That night, Pipkin lay awake, the vision burning in his mind. The path ahead was no longer just about knighthood—it was about saving everything he loved.
