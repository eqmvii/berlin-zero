# Chapter 13: The Knight's Vision

After the trials, Sir Reginald introduced Pipkin to the ancient practice of meditation. The garden was hushed, dew glistening on every leaf, the air scented with lavender and earth. “A knight must see beyond what is before his eyes,” Sir Reginald intoned, his voice gentle but firm. “Close your eyes, breathe, and listen.”

Pipkin settled onto a mossy stone, his small paws folded in his lap. At first, his mind buzzed with thoughts—memories of the trials, worries about the future, the faint laughter of apprentices drifting from the keep. But as he focused on his breath, the world began to fall away. The rustle of leaves faded. The warmth of the sun on his fur became a distant memory. He felt himself drifting, lighter than air.

In the stillness, a strange vision took hold. Pipkin was no longer in the garden. He stood on a windswept plain beneath a sky streaked with fire. The air crackled with energy. Above him, a great shadow fell over the land, blotting out the sun. A voice, neither kind nor cruel, whispered his name—a sound that seemed to echo from the stars themselves. Pipkin’s heart pounded. He looked up and saw the silhouette of a ship—vast, silent, unlike any bird or beast—descending from the heavens, its hull gleaming with alien light.

The ground trembled. Pipkin felt both awe and terror, as if the fate of the world teetered on a knife’s edge. He tried to move, to call out, but his voice was lost in the wind. The ship’s shadow stretched across the fields, swallowing forests, rivers, and villages. Then, just as suddenly, the vision faded.

Pipkin awoke with a gasp, his fur damp with sweat. The garden was quiet once more, the sun dipping low behind the keep’s towers. Hazel was at his side, concern etched in her eyes. “Pip, are you all right? You looked… frightened.”

He struggled to find words. “I saw something. A sky on fire. A shadow—huge, like nothing I’ve ever seen. And a ship, Hazel. It was coming from the stars.”

Hazel’s ears drooped. “Do you think it’s the Starfall?”

Pipkin nodded, his throat tight. “Sir Reginald always said the Starfall was just a legend. But it felt real. Too real.”

They found Sir Reginald in his study, surrounded by ancient scrolls and maps. Pipkin described his vision, every detail tumbling out in a rush. The old knight listened carefully, his face grave.

“You have been touched by a greater destiny, Pipkin,” Sir Reginald said at last. “The Starfall is not just a story to frighten kits. It is real—and you may be the one to face it.”

Hazel squeezed Pipkin’s paw. “You’re not alone, Pip. Whatever this is, we’ll face it together.”

That night, Pipkin lay awake in his bed, the vision burning in his mind. He stared at the ceiling, tracing the cracks in the stone, his thoughts swirling like autumn leaves. The path ahead was no longer just about knighthood—it was about saving everything he loved. Fear gnawed at him, but so did a strange sense of purpose.

He rose quietly and slipped out into the moonlit courtyard. Hazel joined him, silent as a shadow. They sat together beneath the stars, the air cool and filled with the scent of night-blooming flowers.

“Do you think we’re ready?” Pipkin whispered.

Hazel leaned against him. “Maybe not. But we’re braver than we think. And we have each other.”

Pipkin smiled, comforted by her presence. The vision was still frightening, but with Hazel by his side, he felt a flicker of hope. Whatever the Starfall brought, they would face it—together.
