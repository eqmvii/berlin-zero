# Chapter 13: The Knight's Vision

The morning sun cast long shadows across the castle grounds as Sir Reginald led Pipkin to the meditation garden. Ancient stone walls, weathered by centuries of rain and wind, enclosed the space like protective arms. Moss-covered statues of legendary knights stood sentinel among beds of herbs and flowers, their carved eyes seeming to watch the young rabbit's approach.

"Today, you'll learn one of the most important skills a knight can possess," Sir Reginald said, settling onto a worn stone bench. His silver fur caught the early light, giving him an almost ethereal appearance. "The ability to see beyond the physical world."

Pipkin's whiskers twitched with curiosity. "Beyond the physical world, sir?"

"Indeed." The old knight gestured to a cushioned meditation stone. "Knights of old spoke of visions—glimpses of what was, what is, and what may yet be. Through meditation, they learned to quiet their minds and open their hearts to these deeper truths."

After the trials, Sir Reginald introduced Pipkin to the ancient practice. The garden was hushed, dew glistening on every leaf, the air scented with lavender and earth. "A knight must see beyond what is before his eyes," Sir Reginald intoned, his voice gentle but firm. "Close your eyes, breathe, and listen."

Pipkin settled onto the mossy stone, his small paws folded in his lap. At first, his mind buzzed with thoughts—memories of the trials, worries about the future, the faint laughter of apprentices drifting from the keep. Sir Reginald's voice guided him, steady as a heartbeat.

"Feel the breath moving through your body. Let each thought float past like leaves on a stream."

Gradually, Pipkin's racing thoughts began to slow. The garden sounds—birdsong, rustling leaves, the distant murmur of the castle—merged into a gentle symphony. As he focused on his breath, the world began to fall away. The rustle of leaves faded. The warmth of the sun on his fur became a distant memory. He felt himself drifting, lighter than air.

In the stillness, a strange vision took hold. Pipkin was no longer in the garden. He stood on a windswept plain beneath a sky streaked with fire. The air crackled with energy, carrying scents he had never known—metal and ozone and something alien. The grass beneath his paws whispered with ancient secrets, and the wind seemed to speak in forgotten tongues.

Above him, a great shadow fell over the land, blotting out the sun. A voice, neither kind nor cruel, whispered his name—a sound that seemed to echo from the stars themselves. Pipkin's heart pounded. He looked up and saw the silhouette of a ship—vast, silent, unlike any bird or beast—descending from the heavens, its hull gleaming with alien light. Strange symbols pulsed along its surface, casting eerie patterns across the landscape.

The ground trembled beneath his paws. Pipkin felt both awe and terror, as if the fate of the world teetered on a knife's edge. He tried to move, to call out, but his voice was lost in the wind. The ship's shadow stretched across the fields, swallowing forests, rivers, and villages. In its wake, the very fabric of reality seemed to bend and warp. Then, just as suddenly, the vision faded.

Pipkin awoke with a gasp, his fur damp with sweat. The garden was quiet once more, the sun dipping low behind the keep's towers. Hazel was at his side, concern etched in her eyes. She had been practicing her healing arts nearby, her basket of herbs forgotten in the grass. "Pip, are you all right? You looked… frightened. You were trembling."

He struggled to find words, his mouth dry. "I saw something. A sky on fire. A shadow—huge, like nothing I've ever seen. And a ship, Hazel. It was coming from the stars. The air itself felt wrong, as if the world was holding its breath."

Hazel's ears drooped, her paw finding his. "Do you think it's the Starfall? The legend from the old stories?"

Pipkin nodded, his throat tight. "Sir Reginald always said the Starfall was just a legend. But it felt real. Too real. I could smell it, feel it—the power of it. Something is coming, Hazel. Something that could change everything."

They found Sir Reginald in his study, surrounded by ancient scrolls and maps. Dust motes danced in the afternoon light as Pipkin described his vision, every detail tumbling out in a rush. The old knight listened carefully, his face grave, occasionally making notes in a leather-bound journal.

"You have been touched by a greater destiny, Pipkin," Sir Reginald said at last, closing the journal with a gentle thud. "The Starfall is not just a story to frighten kits. It is real—and you may be the one to face it. The ancient texts speak of signs and portents, of a chosen warrior who would see the truth before others."

Hazel squeezed Pipkin's paw. "You're not alone, Pip. Whatever this is, we'll face it together. My healing skills, your courage—we're stronger as one."

That night, Pipkin lay awake in his bed, the vision burning in his mind. He stared at the ceiling, tracing the cracks in the stone, his thoughts swirling like autumn leaves. The path ahead was no longer just about knighthood—it was about saving everything he loved. Fear gnawed at him, but so did a strange sense of purpose. The vision had awakened something in him, a deep understanding that his training had been preparing him for more than just ordinary knightly duties.

He rose quietly and slipped out into the moonlit courtyard, his paws silent on the ancient stones. Hazel joined him, materializing from the shadows like a spirit. They sat together beneath the stars, the air cool and filled with the scent of night-blooming flowers. Above them, the constellations seemed to shine with new significance, as if they too held secrets about the coming storm.

"Do you think we're ready?" Pipkin whispered, his eyes scanning the heavens. "For whatever the Starfall brings?"

Hazel leaned against him, her warmth steadying his racing heart. "Maybe not. But we're braver than we think. And we have each other. Sometimes the greatest adventures start with a vision and a friend who believes in you."

Pipkin smiled, comforted by her presence. The vision was still frightening, but with Hazel by his side, he felt a flicker of hope grow stronger. Whatever the Starfall brought, they would face it—together. And perhaps that was the greatest lesson of all: that even in the face of cosmic threats, the power of friendship and courage could light the way forward.
