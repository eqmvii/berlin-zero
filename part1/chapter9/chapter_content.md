# Chapter 9: The Knight's Mind

The days after Willowbrook's rescue were filled with rebuilding, but Sir Reginald soon called Pipkin and Hazel back to the keep. The old knight’s eyes were sharp as ever. “A true knight must be strong in body and in mind,” he said. “Today, we begin the training of the mind.”

Sir Reginald led them to a quiet study lined with ancient scrolls and maps. He spread out a faded battle plan. “Every battle is won or lost before it is fought. Strategy, anticipation, and wisdom—these are a knight’s greatest weapons.”

Pipkin listened as Sir Reginald recounted tales of legendary battles, pointing out the clever maneuvers and mistakes that changed the course of history. Pipkin and Hazel were tasked with solving riddles and devising plans for imaginary threats: foxes raiding the carrot stores, hawks circling above, even the possibility of a flood.

At first, Pipkin struggled. He wanted to rush in, to act, but Hazel’s quick thinking helped him slow down. Together, they learned to work through problems, weighing risks and rewards. Pipkin began to see patterns, to anticipate what might happen next.

One afternoon, Sir Reginald set up a mock battle in the training yard. Hazel led one team, Pipkin the other. They used pebbles for troops and sticks for fortifications. Pipkin’s team was outnumbered, but he remembered Sir Reginald’s words: “Think before you act.” He set a clever trap, luring Hazel’s forces into a bottleneck and turning the tide.

Sir Reginald clapped his paws. “Well done! You’re learning to use your mind as well as your muscles.”

That night, Pipkin lay awake, thinking about all he’d learned. He realized that courage and strength were important, but so was wisdom. The world was full of dangers, and a knight must always be ready—not just to fight, but to think.

As the moon rose, Pipkin felt a new confidence growing within him. The path of knighthood was not just about bravery or brawn, but about using every part of himself—heart, body, and mind—to serve the greater good.
