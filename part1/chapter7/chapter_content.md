# Chapter 7: The First Battle

A hush fell over the keep as dawn broke, the air heavy with the scent of rain and the promise of something ominous. Pipkin awoke to urgent whispers and the hurried pawsteps of messengers darting through the halls. Sir Reginald’s commanding voice echoed off the stone walls: “All apprentices to the courtyard—immediately!”

Hazel was already at Pipkin’s side, her eyes wide with excitement and worry. “Something’s happened,” she whispered. “Something big.”

They hurried to the courtyard, where Sir Reginald stood, flanked by a group of grim-faced knights. “A band of weasel bandits has been spotted near Willowbrook Village,” he announced. “They threaten the peace of our land and the safety of our friends. Today, we ride not for glory, but to protect the innocent.”

Pipkin’s heart hammered in his chest. This was what he’d trained for, but the reality was far different from the stories he’d grown up hearing. He glanced at Hazel, who gave him a steady nod. “We can do this, Pip.”

The journey to Willowbrook was tense. The woods seemed darker, the usual birdsong replaced by uneasy silence. As they approached the village, smoke curled above the rooftops. Villagers huddled together, eyes wide with fear.

Sir Reginald addressed the crowd. “We are here to help. Stay together and keep to the center of the village.”

Suddenly, a shout rang out—a group of weasels, armed with makeshift clubs and slings, burst from the undergrowth. Pipkin froze, fear rooting him to the spot. Hazel tugged at his paw. “Remember the code, Pip! Protect the weak!”

Sir Reginald led the charge, his armor gleaming as he confronted the bandits. “Stand firm!” he called. “No harm will come to these villagers while we stand!”

Pipkin’s training kicked in. He darted forward, positioning himself between a frightened mouse family and an advancing weasel. The bandit sneered, swinging his club. Pipkin dodged, heart pounding, and shouted, “Leave them alone!”

The weasel hesitated, surprised by the small rabbit’s courage. Hazel, spotting an opportunity, darted behind the bandit and tripped him with a well-placed stick. The weasel tumbled, dropping his weapon.

Elsewhere, the battle raged. Sir Reginald faced the bandit leader, exchanging blows that rang through the village square. Pipkin saw a young squirrel cornered by two weasels. Without thinking, he rushed to help, using his small size to his advantage. He darted between the weasels’ legs, nipping and dodging until the squirrel could escape.

Hazel joined him, her quick thinking and agility turning the tide in their favor. Together, they outmaneuvered the bandits, forcing them back toward the woods.

Finally, with a rallying cry from Sir Reginald, the knights drove the weasels into retreat. The villagers erupted in cheers, rushing to thank their defenders. Pipkin, breathless and trembling, realized he’d done it—he’d faced real danger and stood his ground.

Sir Reginald placed a paw on Pipkin’s shoulder. “You fought bravely today. You remembered the code, even when it was hardest. That is the mark of a true knight.”

Hazel grinned, her fur ruffled and eyes shining. “We make a good team, don’t we?”

Pipkin nodded, pride swelling in his chest. “We do. I couldn’t have done it without you.”

That night, as the village celebrated their safety, Pipkin sat by the fire, the events of the day replaying in his mind. He had learned that courage wasn’t the absence of fear—it was acting in spite of it, for the sake of others.

As the stars shone overhead, Pipkin and Hazel promised each other that, whatever battles lay ahead, they would always stand together, guided by the code and the unbreakable bond of friendship.

Far off in the darkness, a pair of eyes watched the flickering firelight. The Starfall’s shadow loomed ever nearer, but for tonight, hope burned bright in Willowbrook Village.
