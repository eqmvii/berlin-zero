# Chapter 12: The Knight's Trials

The next phase of Pipkin’s training was the most demanding yet. Sir Reginald announced a series of trials, each designed to test a different aspect of knighthood: strength, wit, and heart.

The first trial was a test of strength—scaling the steep cliffs behind the keep. Pipkin’s legs trembled, but Hazel’s encouragement spurred him on. Together, they reached the summit, breathless but triumphant.

The second trial was of wit. Sir Reginald presented them with a puzzle: a locked chest and a riddle. Pipkin and Hazel worked late into the night, piecing together clues until the chest finally clicked open, revealing a simple token of Sir Reginald’s approval.

The final trial was the hardest—a test of heart. Sir Reginald led Pipkin deep into the forest, where a frightened kit was trapped on a narrow ledge. Pipkin’s fear threatened to overwhelm him, but he remembered the code: to protect the weak, even at great risk. He crawled out, heart pounding, and rescued the kit, earning the gratitude of the keep and the pride of his mentor.

Exhausted but elated, Pipkin realized that every trial had shaped him, revealing strengths he never knew he had.

That night, Sir Reginald presented Pipkin with a simple medallion. “You have faced your trials with courage and honor. You are well on your way to becoming a true knight.”
