# Chapter 15: The Journey Continues

The first light of dawn crept over the keep as Pipkin and Hazel packed their belongings for the journey ahead. The halls were quiet, the air tinged with the bittersweet scent of departure. Pipkin rolled up his cloak, checked his satchel for the third time, and paused to look around the room that had become his second home.

Hazel bustled in, her own pack slung over her shoulder. “You ready, Pip?”

He nodded, though his heart fluttered with nerves. “As ready as I’ll ever be.”

They made their way to the main gate, where Sir Reginald waited, pride shining in his eyes. Lady Elara stood beside him, her lute strapped to her back, and Grizelda gave a gruff but affectionate pat on Pipkin’s head.

“You have grown, both of you,” Sir Reginald said, his voice thick with emotion. “The world beyond needs your courage now more than ever.”

Pipkin hugged his old mentor, gratitude and sadness mingling in his chest. “Thank you for everything, Sir Reginald. I wouldn’t be here without you.”

Hazel grinned, nudging Pipkin. “Let’s see what adventures are waiting for us.”

Their friends gathered to see them off, offering hugs, gifts, and words of encouragement. Even Old Briar, the grumpy gardener, pressed a lucky clover into Pipkin’s paw. “For luck, lad. You’ll need it.”

As they stepped onto the road, the keep shrinking behind them, Pipkin felt a new strength—a quiet confidence born of all he had learned. The path ahead was shrouded in mist, the morning sun just beginning to burn through.

They walked in companionable silence for a while, the world waking up around them. Birds called from the hedgerows, and dew sparkled on the grass. Hazel broke the silence. “Do you think we’ll really see the Starfall?”

Pipkin hesitated, then nodded. “I think so. And I think we’ll be ready.”

Hazel smiled. “We’ve faced foxes, storms, and riddles. I’d say we’re a pretty good team.”

They shared a laugh, the tension easing for a moment. But as they crested a hill and looked back at the keep, Pipkin felt a pang of homesickness. “Will it ever be the same when we come back?”

Hazel shook her head. “No. But maybe that’s all right. We’re not the same, either.”

They pressed on, the road winding through fields and forests, each step taking them farther from the safety of home and closer to the unknown. Pipkin found himself thinking of the vision, the promise, and the responsibility that now rested on his shoulders.

At midday, they stopped by a stream to rest. Pipkin skipped stones across the water, lost in thought. Hazel joined him, her gaze thoughtful. “Whatever happens, Pip, I’m glad it’s you and me.”

He smiled, feeling the truth of her words settle deep inside him. “Me too, Hazel. Me too.”

As the afternoon wore on, the sky above shimmered, and a distant star seemed to fall toward the horizon. Pipkin watched it, a chill running down his spine. The Starfall was coming, and the world was changing.

That night, they camped beneath the open sky, the fire crackling and the stars blazing overhead. Pipkin lay awake, listening to the sounds of the wild and thinking of all that lay ahead. He felt fear, yes, but also hope—a hope that whatever came, they would face it together.
