# Chapter 15: The Journey Continues

The dawn broke cold and sharp over the hills of Elderwyn, gilding the stone towers of Sir Reginald’s keep in amber. Pipkin stood at the eastern parapet, his cloak tugged by the wind, eyes fixed on the horizon where the road twisted through the lowlands like a coiled serpent. Behind him, the tower bells sang the morning’s first chime.

Hazel emerged from the stairwell, her boots thudding softly against the stone as she joined him. She carried her pack slung over one shoulder and wore a tunic of forest green—simple, but fit well for travel.

“You ready?” she asked.

Pip turned, his eyes bright despite the shadows beneath them. “More than ever.”

And he meant it. Gone was the unsure boy who had stumbled into the keep half a year ago with tales of glory and a heart full of stories. In his place stood a squire hardened by months of drills, nights of study, and bruises earned under Sir Reginald’s unforgiving blade. He still dreamed, but now his dreams had weight—responsibility. Direction.

Sir Reginald had entrusted them with their first true mission: a scouting journey to the borderlands of Larksend, where strange lights had been seen in the night skies. A minor task, perhaps, but the old knight had been grim when he spoke of it.

“The stars,” he’d said, “are not what they were. Be watchful.”

The message had been sparse, the concern unspoken—but the worry in the knight’s eyes told Pip all he needed. The Starfall. The old stories whispered of it—stars dying in strange patterns, omens of catastrophe, of deep magic waking after centuries of sleep.

Hazel adjusted her satchel, giving him a nudge. “Then let’s go. Before Reginald decides to come along and ruin all the fun.”

Pip grinned. “He’d say he’s improving it.”

They made their way down through the keep, passing servants lighting braziers and guards saluting with faint smiles. Many had seen them train, grow, stumble and rise. The pair had become something of a known pair—Pip with his relentless optimism, Hazel with her fierce pragmatism. If anyone could handle strange skies, it was them.

At the gate, Sir Reginald waited. He wore his formal armor, not the practice set. That alone sobered Pip’s expression.

“You ride light,” Reginald observed, giving their packs a glance.

“We’ll move faster that way,” Hazel replied, her tone even.

“Good.” He stepped forward, clasping Pip’s shoulder. “You know what to look for?”

“Strange lights. Disturbed land. Missing scouts. Anything that doesn’t belong,” Pip recited.

“And what do you do when you find it?”

Pip’s smile faded. “We send word. We do not engage unless there is no choice.”

Reginald nodded. “There’s wisdom in knowing when not to draw your blade. Remember that.”

Hazel, uncharacteristically, gave a stiff bow. “We’ll return with news, not glory.”

That earned the faintest hint of a smile from the old knight. “That would be a welcome change.”

They rode out at midmorning, their horses cutting a brisk pace across frostbitten ground. The road narrowed as they passed through the Vale of Needles, where black pines loomed and sunlight grew shy. Pip found himself quiet, the rhythm of hooves a steady drumbeat in his thoughts.

“You’re thinking about it,” Hazel said, not looking at him.

He didn’t need to ask what she meant. “The Starfall? Yeah.”

“It could be nothing. Just a freak phenomenon.”

“And if it’s not?”

She sighed. “Then we do what we were trained to do.”

The first signs came two days in.

They reached the village of Dunswell near dusk, only to find it abandoned. Doors hung open. Hearths were cold. Not a soul remained.

“Scavengers?” Hazel guessed, checking a cellar.

“No signs of struggle,” Pip said, crouching near a line of tracks. “People left on their own.”

Hazel came beside him. “Or were told to.”

That night, they camped on a ridge overlooking the silent fields. The stars above shone too bright, too clear. Pip stared upward long after Hazel slept, and it was then that he saw it—a streak of light, not a shooting star, but something slower. Red. Pulsing.

It burned across the sky like a wound opening in heaven.

And then it vanished.

Three days later, they reached the outskirts of Larksend.

The fields there had withered strangely—rows of grain reduced to ash-gray stalks despite the season. Animals refused to enter the area. Hazel’s mare balked, nearly throwing her as they tried to pass a half-burnt barn.

“We’re close to something,” Pip said, his voice hushed.

They dismounted, proceeding on foot.

As they crested a low hill, they saw it.

In the center of a barren glade stood a crater—deep and blackened, its edges melted like wax. The ground around it shimmered with unnatural frost, despite the spring air.

Hazel approached first, a hand on her short sword. “What fell here?”

Pip knelt by the edge, examining the glassy soil. “Something from the sky.”

She glanced upward. “One of the stars?”

He didn’t answer.

The crater pulsed faintly with residual heat. At its heart lay a shard—jagged, metallic, humming with low resonance. Pip reached out, then hesitated. Every instinct screamed to pull back.

“Don’t,” Hazel said.

He drew his hand away.

They sent word via messenger hawk, including sketches and soil samples. Sir Reginald’s reply came two days later, urgent and brief:

Return immediately. The Starfall is no longer a legend.

Avoid further contact. You are not alone.

They broke camp that night.

But by then, it was too late.

Their return path was blocked by fire.

Pillars of flame had erupted from the trees, unnatural and silent. Shapes moved within the inferno—tall, twisted, faceless. Hazel drew her blade.

“Pip—!”

“I see them.”

He pulled her behind a boulder as the air shimmered with heat. The shapes did not advance. They merely watched.

Then came a voice. Cold. Metallic.

“You do not belong here.”

Pip stepped forward, defiant. “Who are you?”

The voice replied from all directions. “We are the first to fall. The last to rise.”

Hazel raised her sword. “What do you want?”

“To wake the earth. To burn the sky. To make ready the return.”

The flames receded as swiftly as they had come. The forest returned to silence.

Pip was pale. Hazel was shaking.

“That wasn’t a warning,” she said. “That was a claim.”

By the time they returned to the keep, it was under siege—not by flame, but by fear. Scouts had reported more craters. Villages had vanished. The stars above now moved in patterns no scholar could predict.

Sir Reginald met them in the hall, a grim light in his eyes.

“What did you see?” he asked, before they had even removed their cloaks.

Pip told him everything. The crater. The shard. The watchers in flame.

When he finished, Reginald said only: “It has begun.”

He took them to the war chamber, where ancient maps lined the walls. He pointed to a star chart, ink still fresh.

“They are falling here,” he said, tapping three locations. “And here. And here. All near old sites of power—forgotten, buried. Sealed for centuries.”

Hazel frowned. “This isn’t just a phenomenon. It’s a pattern.”

Reginald nodded. “A summoning.”

Pip stepped closer. “Then what do we do?”

The knight looked at him—truly looked—and for the first time, Pip saw fear in his eyes.

“You train harder. You learn faster. And when the time comes, you don’t hesitate.”

He turned to a locked chest, drawing out a long blade wrapped in velvet. He handed it to Pip.

“This sword belonged to the last knight who faced the Starfall. It has not seen daylight in three hundred years.”

Pip accepted it, hands trembling. The blade was warm to the touch, as if it remembered the fires it had once tasted.

“Why give this to me?”

Reginald looked at him with a strange mix of sorrow and pride.

“Because the old stories don’t end. They begin again.”

That night, Pip stood alone in the training yard. The stars watched him like eyes, distant and unknowable. He held the ancient blade in both hands, its edge catching the moonlight.

He was no longer a boy chasing glory.

He was a spark in a world about to burn.

And the Starfall was far from over.
