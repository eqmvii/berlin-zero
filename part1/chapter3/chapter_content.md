# Chapter 3: The Call

The sun had barely crested the horizon when Pipkin awoke to a hush that seemed to settle over the entire warren. The usual morning bustle was replaced by a tense, expectant quiet. Pipkin’s dreams had been restless, filled with shadowy figures and distant, beckoning voices. He blinked sleep from his eyes, heart fluttering with a strange anticipation.

He wasn’t the only one who sensed something was different. His mother, Clover, stood at the entrance of their burrow, her ears perked and her nose twitching at every sound. Pipkin’s father, Bramble, busied himself with breakfast, but his movements were stiff, his eyes flickering to the mouth of the tunnel.

Hazel, ever the early riser, was already outside, scanning the meadow. She caught Pipkin’s eye and gave him a reassuring nod. “Big day, Pip,” she whispered as he joined her in the soft morning light. “I can feel it.”

Before Pipkin could respond, a commotion rippled through the grass. Rabbits parted in awe as Sir Reginald strode into view, his battered armor gleaming in the sunlight. The knight’s presence commanded respect; even the youngest kits fell silent, their eyes wide with wonder.

Sir Reginald stopped before Pipkin’s family burrow. With a voice that carried the weight of countless seasons, he announced, “I come to seek an apprentice. One who has shown courage, wit, and heart beyond his years. Pipkin, will you step forward?”

Pipkin’s world seemed to shrink to a single point. He felt the eyes of the entire warren upon him. His mother’s breath caught, her paws trembling. Bramble placed a steadying paw on her shoulder, pride and worry warring in his gaze.

Hazel nudged Pipkin gently. “Go on. This is your moment.”

With legs that felt like reeds in the wind, Pipkin stepped forward. “Sir Reginald, I—I am honored.”

Sir Reginald knelt so his eyes were level with Pipkin’s. “This path is not easy. There will be dangers, and you may not return the same. But I see in you the spark of something great. Will you accept the call?”

Pipkin swallowed, searching his heart. He thought of the fox cubs, the mouse he’d saved, and the stories of heroism that had filled his dreams since he was a kit. “I accept.”

A murmur swept through the crowd. Some faces shone with pride; others were clouded with fear. Clover gathered Pipkin close, her voice trembling. “Oh, my little one… I always knew you were meant for more, but I hoped it wouldn’t come so soon.”

Bramble, voice thick with emotion, said, “You have our blessing, son. Make us proud—but come home safe.”

Hazel grinned, her eyes bright with excitement and a hint of jealousy. “You’ll need a friend on the road, you know.”

Sir Reginald placed a gentle paw on Pipkin’s shoulder. “You have tonight to say your goodbyes. At dawn, we leave.”

That evening, the warren gathered for a farewell feast. Pipkin sat beside his parents, the weight of the day settling on his small shoulders. Stories were told—of old heroes, of battles won and lost, of the Starfall that haunted the edge of every legend. Pipkin listened, heart pounding, as the elders spoke of destinies and omens.

As night fell and the stars blinked awake, Pipkin wandered away from the warmth of the burrow. He found Hazel sitting by the old willow, her gaze fixed on the sky. “Are you scared?” she asked quietly.

Pipkin nodded. “A little. Everything’s changing so fast.”

Hazel smiled, her voice soft but fierce. “Change is the beginning of every great story. And you’re not alone.”

They sat in silence, the meadow stretching out before them, silvered by moonlight. Pipkin’s thoughts drifted, and soon, sleep claimed him.

In his dream, Pipkin stood at the edge of a vast, unfamiliar land. The grass was taller, the shadows deeper, and the sky shimmered with strange lights. A voice, ancient and kind, echoed in his mind: *You are called, little one. Beyond the meadow lies your true test. The Starfall stirs. Be brave.*

He turned to see Hazel beside him, her eyes shining with determination. Together, they stepped forward, the unknown stretching before them like a promise.

Pipkin awoke with a start, the dream lingering like mist. The first light of dawn crept into the burrow. He rose quietly, careful not to wake his parents, and padded outside. Sir Reginald was already waiting, his silhouette noble against the rising sun.

Hazel appeared, a small bundle slung over her shoulder. “You didn’t think I’d let you go alone, did you?”

Pipkin grinned, relief flooding him. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”

Sir Reginald nodded approvingly. “A knight is only as strong as the friends who walk beside him. Let us begin.”

With a final look back at the warren—at the home that had shaped him, the family that had loved him, the friends who believed in him—Pipkin squared his shoulders and stepped onto the path that would lead him far beyond the meadow.

The call had come, and Pipkin had answered. Whatever waited beyond the horizon, he would face it with courage, hope, and the steadfast companionship of those who mattered most.

As the trio set out, the meadow seemed to hold its breath. Somewhere in the distance, a star flickered in the morning sky, brighter than all the rest—a silent herald of the adventures yet to come.
