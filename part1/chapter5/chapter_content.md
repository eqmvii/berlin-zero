# Chapter 5: The First Lesson

The keep was nothing like Pipkin had imagined. Its ancient stone walls were cold and unyielding, and the great hall echoed with the footsteps of generations of knights. Gone were the comforts of the warren, the warmth of his family, and the gentle laughter of the meadow. Here, everything was unfamiliar, and every shadow seemed to whisper of challenges yet to come.

Pipkin’s first morning as an apprentice began before dawn. Sir Reginald’s voice boomed through the sleeping quarters. “Up, apprentices! The sun waits for no one!”

Pipkin groaned, blinking the sleep from his eyes. Hazel was already awake, stretching and trying to stifle a yawn. “Come on, Pip,” she whispered, “if we’re late, he’ll have us scrubbing the kitchens.”

They hurried to the training yard, where the grass was slick with dew and the air bit with chill. Sir Reginald stood tall, his battered armor gleaming in the first light. “Knighthood is not for the faint of heart,” he announced. “It is not about glory. It is about service.”

The day’s training was grueling. Pipkin stumbled through drills, his legs aching and his breath coming in ragged gasps. Sir Reginald’s instructions were sharp and uncompromising. “Lower your stance! Watch your balance! Again!”

Hazel, though not officially an apprentice, joined Pipkin in every exercise. She offered encouragement when he faltered, her laughter lifting his spirits when despair threatened to take hold. “You’re doing fine, Pip. Just don’t let him see you cry.”

By midday, Pipkin’s muscles burned. He collapsed onto the grass, panting. Sir Reginald loomed over him. “Do you think knighthood is a game? That it’s about songs and stories?”

Pipkin shook his head, ashamed. “No, sir.”

“Knighthood is sacrifice,” Sir Reginald said, his voice softer now. “It is humility. It is putting others before yourself, even when it hurts.”

The lesson stung more than the training. Pipkin thought of the stories he’d heard as a kit—of brave knights slaying monsters and winning glory. But here, in the shadow of the keep, heroism looked different. It looked like sweat, and pain, and the willingness to get up one more time, no matter how many times you fell.

That night, Pipkin sat alone beneath the stars, his body aching and his heart heavy. Hazel found him there, carrying two small bundles of clover. “You did well today,” she said, nudging one toward him. “Better than you think.”

He managed a weak smile. “I thought it would be different. Easier.”

Hazel shrugged. “Nothing worth doing is ever easy. Besides, you’re not alone.”

They ate in silence, the bond between them growing stronger with every shared struggle. As Pipkin drifted off to sleep, he realized that knighthood was not about being the strongest or the bravest. It was about never giving up, no matter how hard the road became.

The next morning, Sir Reginald greeted them with a rare smile. “You survived your first day. That is more than most.”

Pipkin stood a little taller. The path ahead was long, but for the first time, he felt ready to walk it.

In the days that followed, Pipkin’s training continued. There were moments of doubt, of exhaustion, and even tears. But each time he faltered, Hazel was there to lift him up, and Sir Reginald’s lessons echoed in his mind. Slowly, painfully, Pipkin began to change. He grew stronger, not just in body, but in heart.

And so, the first lesson was learned—not in a single moment of triumph, but in every step, every stumble, and every act of quiet courage that followed.
