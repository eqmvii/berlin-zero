# Chapter 10: The First Quest

The keep buzzed with excitement as Sir Reginald summoned Pipkin and Hazel. “You are ready for your first quest,” he announced. “Strange things have been happening in the Darkleaf Forest. I want you to investigate.”

Hazel’s eyes sparkled with anticipation, but Pipkin felt a flutter of nerves. “What if we’re not ready?” he whispered.

Sir Reginald smiled. “You are more ready than you know. Trust each other—and trust yourselves.”

They set off at dawn, the forest looming ahead. The shadows under the trees were thick, and every sound seemed amplified. Pipkin led the way, recalling the strategies he’d learned. Together, they followed clues: strange tracks, broken branches, and the eerie silence of animals hiding.

Deeper in the woods, they discovered a clearing where the grass was scorched and the air tingled with static. Hazel found a feather unlike any she’d seen—metallic blue and shimmering. Pipkin examined the ground and found a strange symbol burned into the earth.

Hazel frowned. “This doesn’t look like anything from our world.”

They pressed on, encountering riddles and dangers: a fallen tree blocking their path, a sudden rainstorm, and a fox lurking in the shadows. Pipkin’s leadership shone as he guided Hazel safely through each challenge.

At dusk, they returned to the keep, their minds swirling with questions. They reported their findings to Sir Reginald, who listened gravely. “You have done well. But I fear this is only the beginning. Something greater stirs in the world.”

That night, Pipkin and Hazel sat by the fire, pondering the mysteries they had uncovered. The first quest had changed them, forging their confidence and hinting at the larger threat looming ever closer.
