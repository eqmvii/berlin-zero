# Chapter 4: The Journey Begins

The first rays of dawn crept across the meadow, gilding the dew and casting long shadows over the burrows. Pipkin stood at the edge of the warren, his heart beating with a mix of excitement and dread. Hazel was beside him, a small bundle slung across her back, her eyes bright with anticipation. Sir Reginald, ever the knight, waited with quiet patience, his battered armor glinting in the morning light.

“Ready?” Hazel whispered, nudging Pipkin’s shoulder.

He nodded, swallowing the lump in his throat. “Let’s go.”

With a final glance back at the warren—the familiar tunnels, the comforting scent of home, the silhouettes of his parents and friends watching from the shadows—Pipkin squared his shoulders and stepped onto the path that would lead him far from everything he’d ever known.

The journey began quietly. The meadow, usually bustling with the gossip of rabbits and the songs of birds, felt vast and unfamiliar. Every sound seemed magnified: the rustle of grass, the distant call of a hawk, the soft crunch of their paws on the earth. Pipkin’s nerves prickled with every step, but Hazel’s presence was a steady comfort.

Sir Reginald led the way, his stride purposeful. He spoke little, but when he did, his words carried the weight of experience. “A knight’s journey is never just about reaching a destination,” he said as they skirted a patch of brambles. “It’s about what you learn along the way.”

Hazel rolled her eyes but smiled. “And what if we learn that brambles hurt?”

Pipkin stifled a laugh, the tension easing between them.

Their first challenge came sooner than expected. As they crossed a narrow stream, Pipkin hesitated at the water’s edge. The current was swift, and the stones slick with moss. Hazel bounded across with ease, but Pipkin’s paws slipped, sending him tumbling into the cold water.

He sputtered, flailing, but strong paws gripped his scruff and hauled him onto the bank. Sir Reginald’s face was stern, but his eyes twinkled. “A knight must learn to keep his footing, even when the ground is uncertain.”

Hazel helped Pipkin shake the water from his fur. “You did fine. Next time, just don’t try to jump like a squirrel.”

They pressed on, the land changing as they moved farther from the warren. The meadow gave way to dense thickets and towering oaks. The air grew cooler, scented with pine and earth. Along the way, they encountered other woodland creatures—an old badger who shared tales of Sir Reginald’s bravery in the battle of the Hollow Oak, a family of field mice who offered them berries and whispered about the mysterious lights seen in the sky.

Each encounter added to Pipkin’s sense of awe. The stories painted Sir Reginald as a hero of legend, a rabbit who had faced monsters and outwitted foxes, who had stood against the darkness when others fled. Pipkin felt small by comparison, his own victories mere pebbles beside the knight’s mountains.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the trees, they made camp beneath a tangle of roots. Sir Reginald tended the fire, his silhouette large and reassuring in the flickering light. Hazel curled up beside Pipkin, her voice hushed.

“Do you think we’ll ever be like him?” she asked, gazing at the knight.

Pipkin considered the question. “I don’t know. But I think… maybe we’re meant to find our own way. Not just follow in his pawprints.”

Hazel smiled. “That’s the bravest thing you’ve said yet.”

Their journey was not without hardship. Rain soaked their fur, and hunger gnawed at their bellies when food was scarce. At times, Pipkin doubted himself—his strength, his courage, his place in this grand adventure. But each time he faltered, Hazel was there to steady him, and Sir Reginald’s quiet confidence urged him onward.

As they neared the keep, the terrain grew steeper. The ancient stones of Sir Reginald’s home rose from the earth like the bones of some forgotten giant. Pipkin’s legs ached, but he pressed on, driven by a mixture of fear and hope.

At the gates, they were greeted by a chorus of voices—rabbits, squirrels, and hedgehogs, all eager to catch a glimpse of the new apprentice. The keep was alive with stories, every corner echoing with the deeds of knights past.

Sir Reginald placed a paw on Pipkin’s shoulder. “This is where your training begins. Knighthood is not given—it is earned, every day, with every choice.”

Pipkin nodded, the weight of the journey settling on him. He glanced at Hazel, who grinned and nudged him forward. Together, they stepped into the keep, ready to face whatever trials awaited.

But as Pipkin crossed the threshold, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the hardest part was yet to come. The path to knighthood was longer and steeper than he’d imagined, and the shadow of the Starfall—distant, but ever-present—loomed at the edge of his thoughts.

Still, with Hazel at his side and Sir Reginald’s wisdom to guide him, Pipkin felt a spark of hope. Whatever challenges lay ahead, he would meet them head-on. The journey had only just begun.

That night, as Pipkin lay beneath the ancient beams of the keep, he dreamed of stars falling from the sky and a voice whispering his name. He awoke with a start, heart pounding, ready for the next step on the path to becoming a true knight.
