# Chapter 6: The Knight's Code

The days at the keep began to settle into a rhythm. Pipkin awoke before dawn, his muscles aching but his spirit growing steadier with each sunrise. Hazel was always at his side, quick with a joke or a word of encouragement, and Sir Reginald’s stern presence became a constant—a guiding star in the unfamiliar world of training and discipline.

One morning, after a particularly grueling set of drills, Sir Reginald called Pipkin aside. The old knight’s eyes were serious, but there was a warmth in his voice Pipkin hadn’t heard before. “It is time you learned what truly makes a knight.”

He led Pipkin and Hazel to a quiet glade behind the keep, where sunlight filtered through the ancient oaks and the air was thick with the scent of moss and wildflowers. There, Sir Reginald produced a battered scroll, its edges worn smooth by countless paws.

“This,” he said, unrolling the parchment, “is the Knight’s Code. Every knight who has stood before these walls has sworn to uphold it. It is not just words, Pipkin. It is a promise.”

Pipkin listened intently as Sir Reginald recited the code:

*To protect the weak and defend the innocent.*
*To act with honor, even when no one is watching.*
*To speak the truth, though it may cost dearly.*
*To serve the greater good above personal gain.*
*To never abandon hope, even in the darkest hour.*

Hazel’s eyes widened. “That’s a lot to live up to.”

Sir Reginald smiled. “It is. And every day, you must choose to live by it.”

He told stories of knights who had come before—of brave does who had rescued lost kits from the jaws of foxes, of clever bucks who had outwitted hawks and weasels, of those who had made sacrifices for the safety of the warren. Some tales ended in triumph, others in heartbreak, but all carried the same lesson: true knighthood was not about glory, but about service.

Pipkin felt the weight of the code settle on his shoulders. He thought of his own journey—the fears he’d faced, the pain of training, the moments he’d wanted to give up. He realized now that each struggle was shaping him, teaching him to be more than he’d ever dreamed.

Later that day, as Pipkin practiced in the yard, he saw a shrew kit being bullied by a pair of older rabbits. The old Pipkin might have hesitated, afraid to get involved. But the words of the code echoed in his mind. He stepped forward, his voice steady. “Leave him alone. That’s not how knights behave.”

The older rabbits sneered, but Sir Reginald’s presence at Pipkin’s back was enough to send them scurrying. The shrew kit looked up at Pipkin with wide, grateful eyes. “Thank you,” he whispered.

That evening, Sir Reginald gathered the apprentices by the fire. “You took your first step today, Pipkin. The code is not just for ceremonies. It is for every moment, every choice.”

Hazel nudged Pipkin, pride shining in her gaze. “You’re starting to sound like a real knight.”

Pipkin smiled, feeling the truth of it deep in his heart. The code was no longer just words—it was a part of him, a compass to guide him through whatever darkness might come.

As the stars wheeled overhead, Pipkin lay awake, the words of the code whispering through his mind. He knew the path ahead would be hard, but for the first time, he felt ready to walk it—not for glory, but for those who needed him most.
