# Chapter 6: The Knight's Code

Sir Reginald introduces Pipkin to the Knight's Code, a set of principles that guide all knights in their duties. Through stories and examples, he teaches Pip about honor, duty, and the responsibilities that come with power. Pip begins to understand that being a knight is about more than personal glory - it's about protecting the weak and serving the greater good. This chapter marks Pip's first steps toward truly understanding what knighthood means.
