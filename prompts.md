## Prompt 1

Add a readme markdown file. It should state that this project is about using windsurf to write a novel. It should be short.

Also create a prompts.md file and add this prompt to it. From here on out, each prompt should be added to that file.

## Prompt 2

Create a plot outline for the novel and save it in a new markdown file. 

This is a fantasy novel about a brown rabbit who grows up to become a knight. The main antagonist should be a space ship. There should be at least 10 characters including the rabbit's best friend, mom, and dad. There should be a subplot about learning new skills and lessons.

As before, save this prompt into prompts.md.

## Prompt 3

The novel will be 3 parts. Each part will be 15 chapters. 

Generate folders for part 1, part 2, and part 3. In each folder generate a folder for each of the 15 chapters.

## Prompt 4

Add the prior prompt, and this prompt, to prompts.md

Also update the chapter numbers - the chapters in part 2 should start at 16, and in part 3 should start at 31

## Prompt 5

Update chapter folder numbers. Part 1 should be 1-15, part 2 should be 16-30, and part 3 should be 31-45

Add this prompt to prompts.md as well

## Prompt 6

Please write summaries for each of the 3 parts and add them as a markdown file in the folder. Remember that the plot_outline.md has the overarching plot in it.

Add this prompt to prompts.md

## Prompt 7

Write the part 3 summary and add this and the prior prompt to prompts.md

## Prompt 8

Create a Dockerfile and docker-compose for this project. The dockerfile will be used to execute a python script to check wordcounts of files in this folder.

This needs to be containerized because I'm on a windows machine and don't want to install or run python. Instead, the dockerfile should have python3 installed, be able to see and run scripts in this repo (probably by volume mounts in the docker-compose), etc.

## Prompt 9

Update the script so that when run, it counts the words for each and every chapter_content.md files located in any folder in this repository - rather than word ocunting arbitrary inputs.
