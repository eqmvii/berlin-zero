# Chapter 32: The First Strike

The Starfall launched its first major attack, sending squadrons of smaller ships to strike at key locations across the kingdom. Pipkin and his team found themselves facing advanced alien technology that seemed to defy their understanding.

"We need to gather intelligence!" Pipkin shouted over the din of battle. "These ships are testing our defenses!"

Grizelda's keen eyes spotted patterns in the attacks, while Thumper used his strength to protect civilians and gather physical evidence. Pipkin coordinated their efforts, using everything they had learned about the Starfall's tactics.

"This isn't just destruction," he realized. "They're learning about us. We need to learn about them!"

As the battle raged on, Pipkin began to see the Starfall's strategy - a methodical approach designed to understand their world and its defenses. He knew they would need to use this knowledge to their advantage in the coming conflict.
