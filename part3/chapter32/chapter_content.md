# Chapter 32: The First Strike

The dawn broke with an eerie stillness that belied the chaos soon to come. Pipkin stood atop the battered ramparts of Willowmere, the heart of the kingdom, as the first rays of sunlight glinted off the dewdrops clinging to the grass below. The air was thick with anticipation, every creature in the city holding its breath. For days, rumors had swirled—strange lights in the sky, crops scorched in perfect circles, farmers whispering of shadows that moved against the stars. But nothing had prepared them for the reality that now descended from the heavens.

A low hum vibrated through the ground, growing into a bone-shaking tremor. Pipkin’s ears twitched. He scanned the horizon, heart pounding. Suddenly, the sky split open with a blinding flash, and from the rift poured a swarm of ships—sleek, silver, and utterly alien. They moved with a precision that sent a chill down his spine, their formation shifting like a living organism.

The Starfall had begun its first major assault.

Pipkin’s mind raced. He glanced at his companions—Grizelda, the sharp-eyed magpie, perched at his side, feathers bristling with tension; Thumper, the burly hare, already bracing his massive frame against the gate, ready to shield the townsfolk with his own body if need be. All around them, the city erupted into motion as the alarm bells tolled, their clangor ringing out across the rooftops.

“Positions!” Pipkin commanded, his voice steadier than he felt. “Remember your training—protect the civilians and gather what you can. We need to understand what we’re facing!”

The first of the alien ships swooped low, its hull shimmering with shifting colors. A beam of pale light lanced out, carving a furrow through the cobblestones. Creatures scattered, some diving for cover, others frozen in terror. Pipkin darted forward, adrenaline sharpening his senses. He snatched a young squirrel from the path of a falling sign, ushering her toward the safety of a cellar. “Stay low! Move quickly!”

Above, Grizelda soared, her keen eyes tracking the enemy’s movements. “They’re not attacking at random!” she called down. “See how they circle the granaries and the water towers? They’re mapping our resources!”

Thumper barreled through the chaos, his powerful legs sending him hurtling toward a cluster of frightened hedgehogs. With gentle but firm hands, he scooped them up, shielding them beneath his broad back as debris rained down. “Keep moving!” he grunted. “Don’t look up!”

Pipkin’s mind worked furiously. The Starfall’s ships were fast, but not invincible. He watched as one of the defenders—a fox with a makeshift spear—lunged at a descending craft. The weapon bounced harmlessly off the alien metal, but the ship veered away, its sensors apparently registering the resistance. Pipkin filed the detail away. “They’re testing us,” he muttered. “Every move we make, they’re watching, learning.”

A sudden explosion rocked the marketplace. Pipkin flinched as a wave of heat washed over him. He turned to see the bakery in flames, its windows shattered. The baker, a stout badger, staggered out, clutching a bundle of flour sacks. Pipkin raced to his side, helping him drag the sacks to safety. “Thank you, Sir Pipkin,” the badger gasped. “They came out of nowhere!”

“We’ll get through this,” Pipkin promised, though doubt gnawed at his resolve. He looked up as another ship hovered overhead, its underbelly opening to release a swarm of small, spider-like probes. They scuttled across the ground, their metallic legs clicking. Grizelda swooped down, snatching one in her beak. She dropped it at Pipkin’s feet.

“Look at this,” she said, her voice trembling with a mix of fear and fascination. “It’s scanning everything—soil, air, even us!”

Pipkin knelt, examining the probe. Its surface was smooth and cold, etched with glowing symbols. He pried it open with his dagger, revealing a tangle of wires and a pulsing blue core. “They’re not here just to destroy,” he realized aloud. “They’re gathering data. Learning how we live, how we fight.”

Thumper joined them, his fur singed but his spirit unbroken. “We need to get one of these to the scholars,” he said. “Maybe they can figure out how it works.”

Pipkin nodded. “Grizelda, can you get this to the library? Tell Professor Oakroot it’s urgent.”

Grizelda took the probe in her talons and launched herself skyward, weaving through the chaos. Pipkin turned to Thumper. “We need to keep the ships busy—draw them away from the heart of the city. Can you rally the defenders?”

Thumper grinned, a wild gleam in his eye. “With pleasure.” He bounded off, bellowing orders and encouragement to the scattered warriors. Slowly, the defenders began to regroup, forming lines of resistance at the city’s edge.

All the while, the Starfall’s ships darted and danced, their attacks growing more precise. Pipkin watched in horror as one ship unleashed a beam that froze the river in an instant, cutting off the city’s main water supply. Another deployed a net of shimmering energy, trapping a group of defenders until Grizelda swooped in, slicing the net with her beak and freeing them.

The battle raged for hours. Pipkin lost track of time, his world reduced to a blur of smoke, shouts, and the acrid tang of fear. He fought alongside his friends, every lesson learned in training put to the test. He saw bravery and sacrifice—mice forming a living chain to rescue a trapped vole, a hedgehog using his spines to puncture a probe, a pair of otters dousing flames with buckets of muddy water.

But for every victory, there was a loss. The city’s defenses buckled under the relentless assault. Pipkin’s legs ached, his lungs burned, but he refused to yield. He climbed atop a toppled statue, raising his sword high. “Hold the line!” he cried. “They want to know what we’re made of—let’s show them!”

A cheer rose from the defenders. For a moment, hope flared. The ships hesitated, as if recalibrating. Pipkin seized the opportunity, signaling to Grizelda. She dove, dropping stones onto the nearest ship’s sensors. The craft jerked, its lights flickering. Thumper hurled a chunk of masonry, striking another ship and sending it careening into a tree.

Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the attack ceased. The ships pulled back, rising into the sky in perfect unison. The hum faded, leaving only the crackle of flames and the moans of the wounded.

Pipkin collapsed to his knees, exhaustion threatening to overwhelm him. Around him, the city lay in ruins—buildings shattered, streets scorched, but the spirit of its people unbroken. Grizelda landed beside him, her feathers singed but her eyes bright with determination.

“They weren’t trying to destroy us,” she said softly. “Not yet. They wanted to see how we’d react.”

Pipkin nodded, piecing together the fragments of the day. “They’re learning about us. Every move we make, they’re watching. But we learned about them, too. Their ships can be blinded. Their probes can be broken. They’re not invincible.”

Thumper limped over, a makeshift bandage wrapped around his leg. “We’ll be ready next time,” he said, voice grim but resolute.

Pipkin looked at his friends, then at the battered city. He felt the weight of leadership settle on his shoulders, heavier than ever before. “We have to be,” he said. “Because this was only the beginning.”

As night fell, the survivors gathered in the square, tending to the wounded and mourning the lost. Pipkin stood watch, eyes fixed on the stars above. Somewhere out there, the Starfall was watching, waiting. But so was he.

And next time, they would be ready.
