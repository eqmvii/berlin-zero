# Chapter 42: The Starfall's Defeat

With Commander Xylar defeated, Pipkin and his team worked quickly to deactivate the Starfall's terraforming systems. Grizelda's technical knowledge proved invaluable as they navigated the alien technology.

"We're doing it!" she shouted as the last system shut down. "The terraforming is stopping!"

The Starfall began to retreat, its massive form rising into the sky. Pipkin watched as it disappeared into space, knowing that their world was safe once more.

"We did it," he said, his voice filled with relief and pride. "We protected our home."
