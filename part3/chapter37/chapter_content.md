# Chapter 37: The Journey Begins

The first blush of dawn painted the sky in hues of lavender and gold as Pipkin tightened the straps of his battered satchel. The forest before them breathed with a hush, dew glistening on every blade of grass, and the lingering mist clung to the ground like a secret. Pipkin paused at the edge of the ancient path, feeling the weight of the journey ahead settle on his shoulders. He glanced back at his companions—Grizelda, her fur bristling with anticipation; Thumper, stretching his powerful hind legs; and Lady Elara, her cloak pulled tight against the morning chill, eyes bright with resolve.

They moved quietly, following the route Whisperwind had revealed in the flickering glow of the council fire the night before. The ancient texts had spoken of this path—a forgotten trail once used by the guardians of the forest, now reclaimed by roots and shadow. Every step felt like trespass and pilgrimage at once.

“Stay alert,” Pipkin whispered, ears twitching. The memory of Whisperwind’s warning echoed in his mind: The Starfall has eyes everywhere.

The forest seemed to listen. Sunlight filtered through the dense canopy in trembling shafts, illuminating motes of dust and the occasional spiderweb strung like silver thread. Grizelda took the lead, her nose quivering as she scanned the undergrowth. Suddenly, she raised a paw, signaling the group to halt.

“There’s something ahead,” she murmured, voice barely above a breath. Pipkin crept forward, careful not to disturb the brittle twigs underfoot. Just beyond a mossy log, an odd glint caught the light—a thin wire, almost invisible, stretched across the path.

“Trap,” Grizelda confirmed, her whiskers brushing the wire. “Starfall tech. If we’d tripped it…”

Thumper’s eyes widened. “What happens if we do?”

Grizelda’s mouth set in a grim line. “We don’t want to find out.”

With deft claws, she disabled the mechanism, revealing a small, camouflaged device—cold metal, humming faintly with alien energy. Pipkin shivered. The Starfall’s reach was everywhere, even here in the heart of the wild.

They pressed on, senses sharpened by adrenaline. The path narrowed, forcing them single file through a thicket of brambles. Thumper took the lead, using his bulk to push aside the thorny branches, shielding the others from the worst of the scratches. His fur snagged and pulled, but he pressed on, grunting with effort.

“Careful, Thumper,” Lady Elara called softly. “We don’t want to leave a trail.”

He nodded, slowing his pace, and together they slipped through the thicket into a small clearing. A chorus of birds erupted overhead, startled by their passage. Pipkin scanned the clearing, eyes lingering on a cluster of strange, metallic flowers—Starfall sensors, disguised to blend with the forest floor.

“We’ll have to go around,” he said, tracing a new route on Whisperwind’s map. The detour would cost them time, but it was safer than risking detection.

As they skirted the clearing, the terrain grew treacherous. The ground sloped steeply downward, slick with mud and tangled roots. Pipkin’s paws slipped more than once, and Lady Elara steadied him with a gentle touch.

“Thank you,” he murmured, embarrassed by his clumsiness.

She smiled. “Even the bravest knights need a hand sometimes.”

A sudden rustle in the undergrowth froze them in place. Grizelda crouched low, ears flattened. From the shadows emerged a pair of sharp eyes—a fox, lean and wary, blocking their path.

Lady Elara stepped forward, her voice calm and melodic. “We mean no harm, friend. We seek only safe passage.”

The fox’s gaze flicked from one companion to the next, lingering on Pipkin’s sword and Grizelda’s claws. “Many travel this way, few return. Why should I let you pass?”

Pipkin swallowed, feeling the weight of the moment. “We’re on a quest to stop the Starfall. Its machines threaten all who call this forest home.”

The fox considered this, tail twitching. “Words are wind. Prove your intent.”

Lady Elara knelt, producing a small pouch of dried berries. “A gift, in the spirit of peace.”

The fox sniffed the offering, then nodded. “You may pass. But beware—the forest is not what it once was.”

As the fox melted back into the shadows, Pipkin let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. “Thank you, Lady Elara. I don’t think I could have talked us out of that one.”

She smiled, but her eyes were troubled. “Not all creatures will be so easily convinced.”

They pressed on, the forest growing darker as the sun climbed higher, blocked by the thickening canopy. Strange sounds echoed through the trees—the whir of distant machinery, the crackle of static in the air. Pipkin’s thoughts turned to the Starfall, hovering somewhere above, its sensors sweeping the land. He imagined its cold, alien gaze searching for them, calculating every move.

As midday approached, the group reached a rushing stream, swollen with recent rain. The bridge that once spanned the water lay in ruins, timbers rotted and swept downstream. Thumper stepped forward, sizing up the gap.

“I can make the jump,” he said, voice steady. “But the rest of you…”

Pipkin shook his head. “We’ll find another way.”

But Thumper was already moving, muscles bunching as he leapt across the churning water. He landed heavily on the far bank, turning to call, “Tie the rope to that tree. I’ll pull you across.”

Working together, they fashioned a makeshift line. One by one, they crossed, clinging to the rope as the current tugged at their legs. Pipkin went last, heart pounding as the cold water surged around him. Thumper hauled him to safety, and the group collapsed on the far bank, breathless and soaked but triumphant.

They rested briefly, sharing a meal of foraged greens and dried fruit. Grizelda kept watch, eyes never still. “We’re being followed,” she said quietly.

Pipkin tensed. “How many?”

“Hard to say. Could be drones, could be something else.”

Lady Elara frowned. “We should move. The longer we linger, the greater the risk.”

They pressed on, nerves fraying with every step. The forest seemed to close in around them, shadows deepening, the air thick with the scent of moss and fear. Pipkin tried to keep his spirits up, recalling the stories of old knights who had braved worse odds. But the Starfall was no ordinary foe.

As afternoon faded to dusk, they reached the edge of a ravine. The only way forward was a narrow, crumbling ledge, barely wide enough for a rabbit’s paw.

“I’ll go first,” Pipkin volunteered, forcing confidence into his voice. He edged along the ledge, heart hammering, every muscle taut. Below, the ravine yawned, dark and unforgiving. One misstep would mean disaster.

Halfway across, a distant whine split the air—the unmistakable sound of a Starfall drone. Pipkin froze, pressing himself against the rock. The drone swept overhead, searchlights slicing through the gloom. Grizelda, Thumper, and Lady Elara flattened themselves against the cliff, barely daring to breathe.

The drone hovered, sensors whirring, then moved on. Only when its sound faded did Pipkin resume his crawl. One by one, the others followed, and at last they reached solid ground.

They collapsed in a heap, nerves jangling. “That was too close,” Thumper muttered, rubbing his ears.

Pipkin nodded, staring up at the darkening sky. “The Starfall is hunting us. We need to move faster.”

Lady Elara placed a reassuring paw on his shoulder. “We made it. That’s what matters.”

Night fell swiftly, the forest transformed into a realm of shadows and whispers. They made camp in a hollow beneath the roots of an ancient tree, concealed from prying eyes. Grizelda set traps of her own, simple but effective, and Thumper gathered firewood while Lady Elara prepared a small meal.

As they huddled together, Pipkin allowed himself a moment of hope. They had survived the first day—a small victory, but a victory nonetheless. He looked at his companions, their faces illuminated by the flickering firelight, and felt a surge of gratitude.

“We’re making progress,” he said, echoing his earlier words. “But we must stay focused. The Starfall won’t make this easy.”

Grizelda nodded, eyes reflecting the flames. “Let it come. We’re ready.”

Thumper grinned, flexing his muscles. “They’ll have to do better than drones and traps.”

Lady Elara smiled softly, her gaze distant. “Tomorrow will bring new challenges. But together, we can face them.”

Pipkin gazed into the fire, the embers swirling like distant stars. The journey had only just begun, and the road ahead was fraught with danger. But for the first time, he felt the stirrings of hope—a belief that, united, they could overcome even the Starfall’s might.

Above them, unseen, the Starfall drifted silently through the night sky, its lights blinking in patterns no creature of earth could decipher. The hunt had begun.
