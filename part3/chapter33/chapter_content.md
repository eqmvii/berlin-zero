# Chapter 33: The Knight's Duty

The great hall of Willowmere was a place Pipkin had visited countless times, but never had it felt so alien. Shadows flickered along the ancient stone walls, cast by the torches that guttered in the wind seeping through shattered windows. The banners of the kingdom—once vibrant with the colors of spring meadows—hung limp, some torn, others stained by smoke and the residue of the Starfall’s relentless attacks. Outside, the distant thunder of the alien ship’s bombardment echoed, a grim reminder that their world was on the brink.

Pipkin’s heart hammered in his chest as he was ushered forward by two of the Queen’s guards. The hall was filled with a tense assembly: wounded knights leaning on crutches, healers tending to the injured, and townsfolk who had sought shelter within the castle’s walls. Eyes followed him, some brimming with hope, others clouded by fear. He caught sight of familiar faces—his friends Bramble and Clover, their fur matted and eyes wide, and Lady Hazel, her dress torn but her chin held high.

At the far end of the hall, Sir Reginald stood waiting. The old knight was a pillar of strength, though his left arm was bound in a sling and a fresh scar ran down his cheek. He leaned heavily on his sword, but his gaze was as sharp as ever. The Queen herself, regal despite her exhaustion, watched from her throne, flanked by her advisors.

A hush fell as Pipkin approached. The ceremony, usually a grand affair filled with music and feasting, was stripped to its barest essentials. There was no time for pageantry—not when the Starfall’s shadow loomed so close.

Sir Reginald’s voice, though strained, carried through the hall. “Pipkin, step forward.”

Pipkin obeyed, his paws trembling. He remembered the first time he had seen Sir Reginald—a legend among rabbits, the hero of the Battle of the Eastern Fields. Never had Pipkin imagined he would stand before him like this.

“Pipkin,” the older knight began, “the kingdom needs you now more than ever. You have shown courage, wisdom, and compassion in the face of terror. You must take up the mantle of leadership.”

A murmur ran through the crowd. Pipkin’s mind raced with memories: the night he first saw the Starfall streak across the sky, the friends he had lost, the lessons learned in the training fields, and the quiet moments of doubt when he wondered if he was truly meant for greatness.

He knelt, as tradition demanded, bowing his head. Sir Reginald’s armor, battered but gleaming with a strange, otherworldly sheen, was brought forth by two squires. It was forged from the very metal of the Starfall—salvaged, studied, and transformed into something new. Pipkin felt the cool weight as each piece was placed upon him: greaves, breastplate, gauntlets. The armor seemed to hum with a quiet energy, as if the knowledge of the ages—and the secrets of the stars—were woven into its core.

As Sir Reginald fastened the last clasp, he leaned close. “This armor is more than protection, Pipkin. It is a symbol. Of hope. Of unity. Of the belief that even in our darkest hour, we can rise.”

Pipkin looked up, meeting the knight’s gaze. “I’m afraid,” he whispered, so only Reginald could hear.

“We all are,” Reginald replied softly. “But courage is not the absence of fear. It is the will to act despite it.”

The old knight straightened, raising his sword. “By the power vested in me by the Queen and the council of Willowmere, I name you Sir Pipkin. Knight of the Realm. Defender of the Light.”

The crowd erupted in applause—ragged, desperate, but sincere. The Queen rose from her throne, her eyes shining with unshed tears. “Rise, Sir Pipkin,” she said, her voice ringing with authority. “You are now not just a knight, but a leader in our darkest hour.”

Pipkin stood, the armor heavy on his shoulders, but his resolve heavier still. He looked out over the assembly, seeing not just fear, but hope—fragile, flickering, but alive.

Lady Hazel approached, offering him a battered sword. “You’ll need this,” she said with a wry smile. “It’s seen me through more scrapes than I care to count.”

He accepted it with a grateful nod. “Thank you, Lady Hazel. I’ll do my best to honor it—and you.”

Bramble and Clover hurried to his side, their voices hushed. “We’re with you, Pipkin,” Bramble said, his usual bravado tempered by the gravity of the moment. “All the way.”

Clover nodded, her eyes shining. “Whatever comes, we face it together.”

Pipkin felt a surge of gratitude. He remembered the days when he was just a timid rabbit, dreaming of adventure. Now, adventure had found him—and it was far more terrifying than he’d ever imagined.

A sudden tremor shook the hall. Dust rained down from the rafters, and the torches flickered wildly. A scout burst through the doors, breathless. “The Starfall is moving again! They’re gathering at the northern ridge!”

Panic rippled through the crowd. The Queen raised a hand, silencing the whispers. “Sir Pipkin,” she said, “we look to you. What is your command?”

For a moment, Pipkin froze. The weight of every eye pressed down on him. He thought of his parents, lost in the first wave of attacks. He thought of the lessons Sir Reginald had taught him: to listen, to lead, to never give in to despair.

He drew a shaky breath. “We hold the line,” he said, voice growing steadier. “We gather every able paw—knights, townsfolk, anyone willing to stand. We fortify the northern ridge and prepare for their assault. We will not let the Starfall break our spirit.”

A murmur of approval swept through the hall. The Queen nodded, her expression fierce. “You heard Sir Pipkin. Go—prepare the defenses!”

The hall erupted into motion. Knights strapped on armor, healers gathered supplies, and messengers dashed off to spread the word. Pipkin found himself swept along, giving orders, offering encouragement, and trying to ignore the gnawing fear in his belly.

As the preparations unfolded, Pipkin slipped away for a moment of quiet. He found a window overlooking the fields beyond the castle. Fires burned in the distance, marking the path of the Starfall’s devastation. Yet even in the darkness, he saw pockets of resistance—villagers forming barricades, children helping to carry water, elders tending to the wounded. The kingdom was battered, but not broken.

Sir Reginald joined him, moving slowly. “You did well, Pipkin. Leadership is a lonely burden, but you carry it with grace.”

Pipkin shook his head. “I’m not sure I’m ready.”

“No one ever is,” Reginald said. “But you have something the Starfall will never understand: the heart of a true knight. That is what will save us.”

They stood in silence, watching as dawn crept over the horizon, painting the sky with the faintest hint of hope.

A bell tolled, signaling the final preparations. Pipkin turned to Reginald. “Will you fight beside us?”

The old knight smiled sadly. “My fighting days are nearly done, but I will stand with you—as advisor, as friend. And when the time comes, I will do what I must.”

Pipkin nodded, feeling the last vestiges of doubt melt away. He returned to the hall, where his friends awaited him. Together, they marched to the northern ridge, the weight of destiny upon their shoulders.

As they took their positions, Pipkin looked up at the sky. The Starfall hovered above, a monstrous silhouette against the dawn. But he was not afraid—not anymore.

He raised his sword, the armor humming with energy, and shouted for all to hear, “For Willowmere! For hope!”

And as the enemy advanced, Sir Pipkin stood at the front, ready to defend his home, his friends, and the future of his kingdom.
