# Chapter 33: The Knight's Duty

Amidst the chaos of the Starfall's attacks, Pipkin was summoned to a hastily arranged knighting ceremony. The great hall was filled with tension as Sir Reginald, injured in battle, stood before him.

"Pipkin," the older knight said, his voice strained but determined, "the kingdom needs you now more than ever. You must take up the mantle of leadership."

Pipkin knelt as Sir Reginald placed his full knight's armor on him - armor forged from Starfall metal, imbued with the knowledge they had gathered. "Rise, Sir Pipkin," Sir Reginald said. "You are now not just a knight, but a leader in our darkest hour."

As Pipkin stood, he felt the weight of responsibility. The Starfall threat was real, and he was now at the forefront of the defense. "I will not fail you," he vowed, his voice steady despite the fear in his heart.
